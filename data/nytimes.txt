Recovery divers were focusing on salvaging the aircraft and parts from the Potomac River on Friday as investigators examined the deadly collision involving a passenger jet and an Army helicopter, Washington fire officials said.

Among the questions facing investigators in the aftermath of the worst U.S. air crash in 20 years was whether the helicopter had flown outside its designated path as it approached Reagan National Airport on Wednesday evening. Four people briefed on the matter but not authorized to speak about it publicly said that the helicopter appeared to have been flying higher than air traffic control had approved.

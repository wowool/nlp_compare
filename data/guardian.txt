The president of La Liga, Javier Tebas, has warned that football cannot afford to overlook the threat posed by A22, whose latest proposal for a European Super League was unveiled in December.

Uefa is currently considering how to respond after A22 launched plans for a Unify League, which follows two previous failed concepts. One option is to authorise the plan and let clubs decide whether to jump ship from the Champions League and other existing continental tournaments. There is little evidence A22 could spark a meaningful breakaway despite holding talks with a number of clubs, but Tebas is concerned that a lack of understanding may help an “elitist” idea gain traction.

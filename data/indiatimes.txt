NEW DELHI: The Rashtrapati Bhavan on Friday reacted strongly to remarks made by senior Congress leader Sonia Gandhi who referred to Droupadi Murmu as "poor thing." Sonia used the phrase while responding to queries by media persons on President's address to the joint sitting of Parliament to mark the beginning of the Budget Session.
"The comments made by some prominent leaders of the Congress party are in poor taste, unfortunate and entirely avoidable. It has clearly hurt the dignity of the high office and are unacceptable," the Rashtrapati Bhavan said in a statement.
The President's office was reacting to Sonia Gandhi's remarks that went viral after the President concluded her address. "The poor lady, the President, was getting very tired by the end ... she could hardly speak, poor thing," Sonia Gandhi was heard saying in the video.

The Rashtrapati Bhavan issued a strongly-worded statement refuting Sonia Gandhi's claims without taking her name. It asserted that the President was not tired at any point.
"While reacting to the media on the Hon'ble President's Address to the Parliament, some prominent leaders of the Congress party have made comments that clearly hurt the dignity of the high office, and therefore are unacceptable. These leaders have said that the President was getting very tired by the end and she could hardly speak," the Rashtrapati Bhavan statement read.

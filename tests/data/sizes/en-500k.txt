Title: Americans may find themselves paying the cost of tariffs on imports | CNN Politics
# Americans may find themselves paying the cost of tariffs on imports | CNN Politics.
CNN — .
A day after signing steep new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China, President Donald Trump acknowledged what economists, members of Congress and even some of his own aides — in their previous lives — have been saying all along: Americans may find themselves paying the costs .
“THIS WILL BE THE GOLDEN AGE OF AMERICA!
WILL THERE BE SOME PAIN?
YES, MAYBE (AND MAYBE NOT!),” Trump posted, in all capital letters, on his Truth Social platform.
The message, which appeared in the hour before Trump arrived to his West Palm Beach, Florida, golf club for the second day in a row, amounted to an advance warning.
Trump is serious about fulfilling his campaign promises to end illegal immigration, curb the flow of deadly drugs and rebalance continental trade.
But doing so will be uncomfortable, Trump is suggesting, and could serve to undermine another of his top campaign vows: lowering costs for Americans.
“WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AND IT WILL ALL BE WORTH THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID,” Trump wrote.
“WE ARE A COUNTRY THAT IS NOW BEING RUN WITH COMMON SENSE — AND THE RESULTS WILL BE SPECTACULAR!!!”.
Instead of the new trade war lowering grocery or fuel prices, Trump on Sunday pointed to a result he never mentioned when he was running for president: annexing Canada as an American state.
“Canada should become our Cherished 51st State.
Much lower taxes, and far better military protection for the people of Canada — AND NO TARIFFS!
” he said, repeating an idea he's floated repeatedly since winning the election late last year.
As industries brace for the new tariffs — 25% on goods from Mexico and Canada, and 10% on imports from China — it remains to be seen how long it will take for higher costs to have an impact on American consumers.
The tariffs are set to go into effect Tuesday at 12:01 a.m. ET.
In a tacit acknowledgement that upside pressures could affect Americans' gas and heating costs, Trump levied only a 10% tariff on Canadian oil and gas.
Already, Canada and Mexico have moved to retaliate — reluctantly, in the case of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who said during a somber address from Ottawa late Saturday: “We don't want to be here.”.
Canada's former finance minister Chrystia Freeland, who is running to replace Trudeau as prime minister, said her country would rather not get into a trade war with the US but is determined to stand up for itself.
“We don't want to have this fight, but we are not going to lose it,” she told CNN's Fareed Zakaria on Sunday, calling it a “lose-lose” situation that will end up hurting Americans, since they depend on Canada for many basic goods.
If the back-and-forth tariffs remain in place for a prolonged period, the “pain” Trump warned of could become a reality.
Sen. Tim Kaine argued Sunday on “State of the Union” that Americans will see increased prices at the pump within days and that American businesses will be harmed once the other nations' retaliatory tariffs kick in.
“I'm struck by the irony.
Last week, the president signed an emergency order regarding energy.
There's an energy emergency.
And he just put a 10% tariff on energy from Canada?
” the Virginia Democrat told CNN's Jake Tapper, adding, “The emergency is self-created.”.
Democratic Gov.
Andy Beshear of Kentucky, which Trump won by more than 30 percentage points in the 2024 election, warned of the potential impacts on the state's bourbon industry after the provinces of British Columbia and Ontario directed their liquor boards to remove American alcohol from shelves.
But even some Trump allies have privately hoped that after implementing the harsh new duties — and proving to the world he's willing to act decisively — Trump could eventually ease up, as long as he's extracted some concessions.
Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, told “Fox News Sunday” that the tariffs “are designed to bring about change.
And if the change comes, I think the tariffs probably go away.”.
What exactly those concessions might be, however, isn't clear.
Before implementing the tariffs, Trump did not meet or speak on the telephone with Trudeau or with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum to spell out his demands.
Trudeau said Saturday he'd been trying to reach Trump since the inauguration, but his calls have not been returned.
Briefing reporters Saturday evening, White House officials declined to lay out specific benchmarks that Canada or Mexico could reach in tightening their borders or curbing fentanyl flows that would allow the tariffs to be lifted.
And Trump himself told reporters late Friday he wasn't looking for any concessions at all.
In his social media posting Sunday morning, his rationale for the tariffs extended well beyond punishment for the illicit flow of fentanyl.
“The USA has major deficits with Canada, Mexico, and China (and almost all countries!), owes 36 Trillion Dollars, and we're not going to be the 'Stupid Country' any longer,” he wrote.
“MAKE YOUR PRODUCT IN THE USA AND THERE ARE NO TARIFFS!”.

Title: Inside the grueling effort to recover the bodies of all 67 victims from the mangled wreckage of DC plane collision | CNN
# Inside the grueling effort to recover the bodies of all 67 victims from the mangled wreckage of DC plane collision | CNN.
CNN — .
Families were waiting at the airport to welcome home loved ones when their plane, just minutes from landing, collided midair with a military helicopter in a fiery explosion, plunging 67 lives full of promise into the cold, inky waters of the Potomac River.
The frantic search for survivors started under the cloak of icy darkness.
By morning, the mission had turned into a slow and somber search for the remains of everyone on board.
As of Sunday afternoon, 55 bodies have been identified, DC Fire and EMS Chief John Donnelly said, with the search effort hampered by near-zero visibility in the frigid water , sharp pieces of debris and the mangled metal of the wreckage.
Amid heated political speculation on the cause of Wednesday night's collision and grief-stricken stories from heartbroken loved ones, hundreds of rescue personnel continue to search relentlessly for the remains of every person lost.
“They're getting home and they're crashing and falling into really deep sleeps, and then getting up and going back to work and doing it again,” David Hoagland, president of the Washington, DC, Firefighters Local 36, told CNN.
“However long it takes, they're going to be there.”.
Days later, dangerous and difficult conditions persist, hindering the careful and deliberate efforts of crews working to recover the bodies of victims trapped deep within the wreckage, beyond the reach of divers.
The recovery effort has been extensive, involving nearly every dive team in the area, including the US Coast Guard, the FBI's Washington Field Office dive team, DC Fire and the International Association of Fire Fighters.
Here's how their efforts are unfolding.
## Heavier equipment needed to remove remaining bodies .
The mangled wreckage in the Potomac River has made the recovery effort especially difficult for dive teams, who have struggled to access parts of the plane's fuselage.
These sections will need to be removed to retrieve the remaining bodies, Donnelly said.
“Things have kind of slowed down this weekend because they're waiting on a lot more heavier salvage equipment that's going to be showing up sometime in the next 24 to 36 hours,” Hoagland told CNN on Saturday.
“They're going to be setting up for a pretty complicated operation where they're going to be removing plane parts from the water on Monday.”.
The wreckage of the American Airlines jet broke apart, according to Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy.
The fuselage was found upside down in three sections in the river, which is about 8 feet deep in some areas.
Divers have been using specialized underwater hydraulic rescue tools capable of cutting metal to try to recover as many victims as possible, Hoagland said.
Asked whether authorities are confident about the location of the remaining bodies, Donnelly said, “We think we know where they are,” but “we won't know until we're done.”.
“I believe that when we remove the aircraft, that that will help us resolve this number,” he said.
“If it doesn't, we will continue the search.”.
The Army Corps of Engineers will start working to remove the remnants of the jet Monday, according to a news release .
Then, engineers will switch their focus to the remnants of the Black Hawk helicopter involved in the collision.
They expect to finish removing the wreckage by February 12, the release says.
A US Coast Guard boat equipped with a crane was used Friday to hold the door of the US Army Black Hawk helicopter, allowing for the retrieval of the bodies of all three service members, followed by the “dignified transfer of their remains,” Hoagland said.
The wreckage of the helicopter was located about 300 yards from the plane debris, according to Hoagland.
Most of Friday's recovery operations focused on the Black Hawk.
Recovery teams are planning to bring a larger crane to the Potomac crash site to help reach victims in a section of the wreckage divers can't access, a law enforcement source told CNN.
The crane, used to remove parts of the Francis Scott Key Bridge after its collapse last March, will be employed to cut and lift pieces of the airplane.
This will allow divers to safely recover additional victims who are pinned inside and extremely difficult to access.
“With these really large marine salvage cranes and vessels, as you can imagine, these things are not very seaworthy,” Hoagland said.
“They can't move very fast because they've got giant cranes on them, so it's slow sail to get up the bay and then into the river to get up to DC.”.
Rescue teams are also on the water using technology such as sonar scanning to continue their search and deploy divers.
Additionally, crews will search sewer lines and conduct aerial operations as dive teams work in targeted areas, according to Donnelly.
## Dangerous, difficult and risky conditions .
When a direct line to Reagan National Airport rang Wednesday night, Hoagland said, Local 36 first responders expected a routine report of a flight in distress.
Instead, they heard: “Crash!
Crash!
Crash!
” he recalled.
As union members rushed to a pier to board a fireboat, burning debris rained down on Potomac.
First responders arrived to find wreckage submerged in the shallow water and almost immediately started finding victims, Hoagland said.
Some passengers were still strapped to their seats, but removing them proved difficult as sharp pieces of debris tore the wetsuits worn by first responders.
“They had a lot working against them.
They had the current in the river.
They had jet fuel all over in the water with them.
They had debris.
They had ice,” Edward Kelly, general president of the International Association of Fire Fighters, told CNN on Thursday. “
Like I said, the swift current was a challenge, searching the fuselage - there's a lot of sharp objects in the cockpit - so it was a very difficult and risky and dangerous rescue attempt.”.
At one point, there were close to 50 divers in the water responding to the incident, he said.
“One thing that was a blessing was the civilian dinner boat in DC did a trip up the Potomac yesterday, which actually broke the ice that allowed the smaller boats to respond to the actual crash last night,” he said.
On the night of the crash, emergency crews battled icy, choppy waters, Donnelly said . .
“The water is dark, it is murky, and that is a very tough condition for them to dive in.
If you can imagine, the river is a large black spot at night with no lights on it, except for a few buoy lights,” Donnelly said.
Friday, search crews continued to exercise caution as weather conditions posed challenges for recovery efforts, Donnelly said.
Divers faced intense mud and near-zero visibility, despite the aircraft resting in only a few feet of water.
“That's actually part of the challenge, is that you're half swimming, half walking while you're working.
This is very strenuous for our divers or rescue swimmers that are in the water,” Donnelly said, referring to the silt at the bottom.
Saturday, calmer weather — with sunshine and fewer winds — helped with visibility, but ice and debris remained critical hazards, Hoagland told CNN.
He added officials are still in the process of mapping the debris field.
“Now that it's a recovery operation, it's much more important to preserve evidence so they can investigate the crash, so they're going to go about it systematically, methodically and intentionally,” Hoagland said.
“They're doing a good job of cataloging and mapping everything by sonar and figuring out where everything is, but it's a tedious, long effort.”.
With the operation shifted from a rescue to a recovery mission, responders are adopting an approach that prioritizes safety, according to Kelly.
For instance, responders will not perform dangerous night dives.
First responders and emergency personnel, who have been working around the clock for days — first desperately searching for survivors, and now recovering remains — are exhausted, Hoagland said, but remain resilient.
“Everybody just really wants to see things through,” Hoagland told CNN.
“We're looking out for each other, and everybody's getting breaks.”.
Recovering the bodies and remains of the victims, especially the children, has been both harrowing and exhausting, Hoagland said, a process that will likely leave a lasting emotional and mental impact on first responders.
To support first responders dealing with the trauma of what they're witnessing on the scene, the International Association of Fire Fighters has deployed teams of former firefighters trained as mental health counselors to assist with ongoing recovery efforts.
“If somebody's really just having a tough time and they need to hit the pause button, they can talk to them and help them decompress and process all the trauma they might be experiencing,” Hoagland said.
There are enough teams on the ground for everyone to provide each other with peer support and take someone's place if they are overwhelmed and need a break, Hoagland said.
Donnelly also emphasized the importance of making sure personnel “understand that the feelings they have are normal and how to get help if there's any feelings that aren't going away, the signs and symptoms, if you're having trouble sleeping, if you aren't eating well, we don't want you to drink, we don't want you arguing with your family,” he said in a news conference Sunday.
The US Coast Guard has Critical Incident Stress Management therapists and chaplains who are waiting for US Coast Guard crews to return to home base and will provide them with mental health support immediately, the agency's Capt. Patrick Burkett said at the news conference.
“This is not normal, and it's OK for them to not feel OK,” Burkett said.
“This is a tragedy,” Donnelly said.
“We are in a business where we deal with the loss of life or people being hurt and one person is bad, and it's hard — and 67 is a lot.”.
The National Transportation Safety Board will allow first responders to complete their work before beginning its investigation into the collision, the board's chair said Thursday.
NTSB Chair Jennifer L. Homendy described it as an “all-hands-on-deck event.”
The NTSB had a full crew on the scene Thursday, with about 50 people at the crash site and additional personnel at the agency's headquarters and labs across the country ready to assist.
But first, “we allow the responders to do their important safety mission, which in this case was search and rescue and recovery,” she said.
“We stand back to allow them to do their important safety mission.”.
Homendy emphasized the NTSB will “leave no stone unturned in this investigation” and that it will be a “whole-of-government effort.”.

Title: Luka Doncic breaks silence following trade from Dallas Mavericks: 'I wanted so badly to bring you a championship' | CNN
# Luka Doncic breaks silence following trade from Dallas Mavericks: 'I wanted so badly to bring you a championship' | CNN.
CNN — .
In his first comments since being traded to the Los Angeles Lakers earlier Sunday, NBA superstar Luka Doncic penned a thank you letter to the Dallas Mavericks, their fans and the city of Dallas.
“Seven years ago, I came here as a teenager to pursue my dream of playing basketball at the highest level,” Doncic wrote in a post on X. “I thought I'd spend my career here and I wanted so badly to bring you a championship.
The love and support you all have given me is more than I could have ever dreamed of.
For a young kid from Slovenia coming to the U.S. for the first time, you made North Texas feel like home.” .
In one of the most stunning trades in league history, the Lakers acquired Doncic, as well as Maxi Kleber, Markieff Morris from the Dallas Mavericks for Anthony Davis, Max Christie and the Lakers' 2029 first-round draft pick.
ESPN's Shams Charania first broke the news of the blockbuster trade on Saturday, citing sources.
“In good times and bad, from injuries to the NBA Finals, your support never changed,” Doncic continued.
“Thank you not only for sharing my joy in our best moments, but also for lifting me up when I needed it most.”.
Doncic, 25, is currently out with a calf injury but has averaged 28.1 points, 8.3 rebounds and 7.8 assists per game in 22 games with the Mavericks this season.
Doncic added: “To all the organizations I've worked with throughout the Dallas community, thank you for letting me contribute to your important work and join you in bringing light to those who need it.
As I start the next part of my basketball journey, I am leaving a city that will always feel like a home away from home.”.
A part of the three-team deal, the Utah Jazz are acquiring Jalen Hood-Schifino, a 2025 Los Angeles Clippers second-round draft pick, and a 2025 Mavericks second-round pick to round out the trade.
The five-time All-Star said he was “grateful” for the opportunity to play in Los Angeles alongside LeBron James.
“Basketball means everything to me, and no matter where I play the game, I'll do so with the same joy, passion and goal - to win championships.,” Doncic said.
Per ESPN's Tim MacMahon, the Mavericks had “major concerns” with Doncic's conditioning and impending potential supermax contract extension.
Even with those concerns going public, it's still a shocking decision by the organization - Doncic was on the All-NBA Team for the last five years and made five consecutive All Star teams before this season when he's been limited by injury.
“Dallas is a special place, and Mavs fans are special fans.
Thank you, from the bottom of my heart,” Doncic posted .
While there is no timetable for Doncic's return to the court, the Lakers are next scheduled to play on Tuesday against crosstown rivals Los Angeles Clippers at the Intuit Dome.

Title: A trans National Guard pilot was falsely accused of flying the helicopter in the fatal plane collision | CNN Business
# A trans National Guard pilot was falsely accused of flying the helicopter in the fatal plane collision | CNN Business.
CNN — .
A trans member of the National Guard is speaking out after a wave of claims on social media falsely pointed to her as the pilot of the Black Hawk helicopter that collided with a passenger jet in Washington, Wednesday, killing 67 people.
Jo Ellis, a UH60 Black Hawk helicopter pilot for the Virginia Army National Guard, posted on Facebook Friday to dispel the rumors that had echoed President Donald Trump's unsubstantiated blaming of diversity initiatives for the fatal accident.
“Some craziness has happened on the internet and I'm being named as one of the pilots of the DC crash,” Ellis wrote.
“It's insulting to the victims and families of those lost and they deserve better than this BS from the bots and trolls of the internet.”.
In her Facebook post, Ellis shared a screenshot of two X posts that linked her being trans to the catastrophic crash, with one user saying they “wouldn't be surprised” if “the pilot was trans” in response to another post that claimed Ellis “has been making radicalized anti-Trump statements on socials.
The latter account has since deleted the post and published an apology .
A separate account, which has a blue checkmark and 13,600 followers, shared a now-deleted post directly attacking Ellis and spreading the bogus conspiracy theory.
While the account has likewise issued a correction , the post still raked in at least 195,000 views and was reshared almost 1,000 times before being deleted.
At the time of both corrections, “Jo Ellis” was the No. 3 trending topic on X, with 19,400 posts.
And, despite Ellis' correction — which she further addressed in a follow-up Facebook video , captioned “proof of life” — far-right accounts on X have continued to spread misinformation and hate speech.
Ellis' erroneous scapegoating in far-right circles follows the ﻿guardswoman's publicized sit-down with CNN's Michael Smerconish, slated to appear in Saturday's episode of “The Smerconish Podcast” during which she discussed her service and experiences with gender dysphoria.
In an essay for Smerconish's newsletter , Ellis also discussed her story, writing about transitioning while serving in the military.
Hate speech following the crash echoed recent attacks from Trump on DEI initiatives and executive actions targeting transgender Americans.
Since returning to the Oval Office, Trump has repeatedly taken aim at transgender people, saying in his inauguration speech “that there are only two genders: male and female.”
Amid his flurry of executive orders, Trump has also re-banned transgender Americans from serving in the military , reviving his 2017 order that was repealed by then-President Joe Biden in 2021 .
And, in his first White House briefing room address , Trump directly linked the crash to DEI while also blaming initiatives from Democrats.
“We must have only the highest standards for those who work in our aviation system,” Trump said.
“I changed the Obama standards from very mediocre at best to extraordinary, you remember that.”.
“Only the highest aptitude, they have to be the highest intellect and psychologically superior people, were allowed to qualify for air traffic controllers,” he said.
In a Thursday White House memo , Trump blamed the Obama administration's implementation of “a biographical questionnaire at the FAA to shift the hiring focus away from objective aptitude,” further linking the crash to DEI initiatives.
“The Biden Administration egregiously rejected merit-based hiring, requiring all executive departments and agencies to implement dangerous 'diversity equity and inclusion' tactics, and specifically recruiting individuals with “severe intellectual” disabilities in the FAA,” Trump wrote in the memo.
Neither the memo nor Trump's press conference provided any evidence to support his brazen claims.
When one reporter pressed the president for an explanation of his diversity claims during the press conference, Trump again failed to provide evidence, responding simply: “Because common sense and unfortunately a lot of people don't.”.
Baseless DEI attacks have become one of the key pillars of the president's MAGA platform, and Trump is far from alone in linking disasters to diversity initiatives.
When disastrous wildfires erupted in California, Elon Musk used his X pulpit to claim “DEI means people DIE,” while others took aim at Karen Bass , the first woman and second black person to serve as Los Angeles mayor.
Conservatives likewise blamed Kristin Crowley , the city's first woman and openly gay fire chief, for the wildfires that killed 28 people.
Other incidents have also been linked to DEI initiatives.
Rep. Dan Meuser told Fox News that the New Orleans' New Years Day tragedy was because “the priority of the last four years has been DEI, not IEDs.”
And Phil Lyman , the one-time Maryland gubernatorial hopeful, blamed the Baltimore Key Brdieg disaster on “governors who prioritize diversity.” .

# UK to target AI child sex abuse tools in world first legal crackdown | CNN.
London Reuters — .
Britain will make it illegal to use artificial intelligence tools that create child sexual abuse images, it said on Saturday, becoming the first country in the world to introduce the new AI sexual abuse offenses.
Possessing, taking, making, showing or distributing explicit images of children is a crime in England and Wales.
The new offenses target the use of AI tools to “nudeify” real-life images of children.
The move comes as online criminals increasingly use AI to create child abuse material, with reports of such explicit images rising nearly five-fold in 2024, according to the Internet Watch Foundation.
“We know that sick predators' activities online often lead to them carrying out the most horrific abuse in person,” said Yvette Cooper, the United Kingdom's interior minister.
“It is vital that we tackle child sexual abuse online as well as offline so we can better protect the public from new and emerging crimes.”.
Predators also use AI tools to disguise their identity and blackmail children with fake images to force them into further abuse, such as by streaming live images, the government said.
The new criminal offenses include the possession, creation or distribution of AI tools designed to create child sexual abuse material and the possession of so-called AI “pedophile manuals,” which provide instructions on the usage of the technology.
Another specific offense will target those who run websites on which child sexual abuse content is distributed.
The government will also enable authorities to unlock digital devices for inspection.
The measures will be included in the Crime and Policing Bill when it comes to parliament.
Britain said earlier this month it would also make the creation and sharing of sexually explicit “deepfakes” - videos, pictures or audio clips made with AI to look real - a criminal offense.

Title: Karla Sofía Gascón says she will not withdraw from Oscar contention over past comments: 'I have not committed any crime' | CNN
# Karla Sofía Gascón says she will not withdraw from Oscar contention over past comments: 'I have not committed any crime' | CNN.
CNN — .
Oscar nominee Karla Sofía Gascón, the star of “Emilia Pérez,” is staying in the race for best actress despite controversy over offensive social media posts .
In an interview with CNN's Juan Carlos Arciniegas, Gascón, who made history last month as the first openly transgender actress nominated for an Oscar in an acting category, once again offered her “most sincere apologies to all the people who may have felt offended.”.
“I cannot step down from an Oscar nomination because I have not committed any crime nor have I harmed anyone.
I am neither racist nor anything that all these people have tried to make others believe I am,” Gascón told CNN.
The controversy arose after journalist Sarah Hagi shared screenshots of Gascón's old social media posts, in which she was critical of Muslim culture, the death of George Floyd and the direction of the Oscars.
Gascón, who deactivated her account on X following the controversy, apologized this week for her posts.
“I want to address the conversation around my past social media posts that have caused harm,” Gascón said in a statement shared with CNN.
“As a member of a marginalized community, I know this suffering all too well and deeply regret having caused pain.
All my life I have fought for a better world.
I believe that light will always triumph over darkness.”.
In one of the posts, originally written in Spanish, Gascón commented on the Floyd case, who died in 2020 after an encounter with police in Minneapolis.
“I really believe that very few ever cared about George Floyd, a scammer drug addict,” she wrote in part.
The actress also criticized the 2021 Oscars ceremony, held amid the Covid-19 pandemic.
“The #Oscars are increasingly resembling an independent and vindicative film awards ceremony, I didn't know if I was watching an Afro-Korean festival, a Black Lives Matter demonstration, or March 8th,” she posted at the time.
In her interview with CNN, Gascón said she didn't “recognize” some of the posts that have resurfaced.
“I have been judged, condemned, sacrificed, crucified, and stoned without a trial and without the option to defend myself,” Gascón said.
She denied writing a since-deleted 2022 tweet in which Selena Gomez, her co-star in “Emilia Pérez,” was described derogatorily.
“It's not mine, of course, I have never said anything about my colleague, I would never refer to her that way,” Gascón said.
Gascón is nominated for an Oscar for best actress for her role in “Emilia Pérez,” a Netflix musical and crime drama that tells the story of a Mexican drug trafficker seeking gender reassignment surgery, which has also generated much controversy, especially in Mexico.
Jacques Audiard, the French director of “Emilia Pérez,” defended the film in an interview with CNN en Español in January, saying, “If there are things that seem scandalous to Mexicans in 'Emilia,' I apologize.” .

# Best red carpet looks at the 2025 Grammys | CNN.
CNN — .
The Grammy Awards are renowned for outlandish fashion.
But on a night of tributes to first responders and victims of LA's recent wildfires, many guests struck a comparatively restrained note at the Crypto.com arena on Sunday.
The all-black trend seen at recent award ceremonies was embraced by everyone from Miley Cyrus (in a cut-out leather Saint Laurent dress) to Olivia Rodrigo (in a slinky halter neck Versace number).
Lady Gaga set a somber tone in a dramatic long-sleeved ball gown by Vivienne Westwood, though some attendees took a more light-hearted approach, whether it was J Balvin's long silk Dior Men coat or the sailor hat Billie Eilish wore with her Prada suit.
Guests also showed their support for LA — which has hosted the Grammys more times than any other city in its 66-year history — by wearing blue heart pins.
Brittany Howard, Jaden Smith and Jacob Collier were among those seen sporting the pins in support of MusiCares, a charity raising money for music industry professionals impacted by the fires.
Elsewhere, several of the evening's most anticipated arrivals used feathers to add volume or definition to their outfits.
Sabrina Carpenter wowed in a custom JW Anderson gown with elegant accents, while the beads and sequins of Cardi B's Roberto Cavalli Couture mermaid gown turned into an autumnal plume as it trailed to the floor.
Meanwhile, Charli XCX and Chappell Roan, who were among the night's most nominated artists, achieved similarly eye-catching effects with ruffles and cascading tulle.
It was perhaps no surprise that both gowns were by the same designer, Jean Paul Gaultier, albeit from very different eras: Charli XCX's outfit was a custom look from the Spring-Summer 2025 runway, while Roan opted for an archive piece from Gaultier's Spring 2003 couture collection.
And this wouldn't be the Grammy's without a bit of skin — or the illusion of it.
The various takes on nude ranged from the subtle (see Madison Beer's divine strapless gown and the sheer detailing of Shakira's Etro dress) to the not-so-subtle.
Ye's wife Bianca Censori left little to the imagination, shocking onlookers by dropping her coat to reveal a see-through slip dress that was, in every sense, barely there.
See below for some of the event's best and boldest looks.
This story will be updated throughout the evening.

Title: Education Department employees placed on paid leave as part of Trump administration's DEI purge | CNN Politics
# Education Department employees placed on paid leave as part of Trump administration's DEI purge | CNN Politics.
CNN — .
Dozens of employees at the Education Department were placed on paid administrative leave Friday as part of the Trump administration's larger effort to rid the federal workforce of employees associated with diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility efforts, two sources familiar with the move told CNN.
The department sent letters to employees informing them that their email accounts were being suspended but that they would continue to receive paychecks for an indefinite period, the sources said.
The department cited guidance from the White House's Office of Personnel and Management, issued on January 21, that directed government agencies to notify “all employees of DEIA offices that they are being placed on paid administrative leave effective immediately as the agency takes steps to close/end all DEIA initiatives, offices and programs.” .
The agency is the latest to face upheaval amid the White House's efforts to weed out DEI programs within the government and reshape the federal workforce in President Donald Trump's image.
At least 55 Education Department employees, including senior-level career workers who have served at the agency for decades, were notified Friday night that they'd been placed on paid leave, according to the American Federation of Government Employees, the union representing the agency's career officials.
“Effective January 31, 2025, you will be placed on administrative leave with full pay and benefits pursuant to the President's executive order on DEIA and further guidance from OPM,” the letter says, according to a copy obtained by CNN.
“This administrative leave is not being done for any disciplinary purpose.”.
According to the union, these employees do not hold job titles nor official duties related to DEIA, but they included staffers such as civil rights attorneys who handle student discrimination and antisemitism complaints; an employee working in a grant office; and a member of the artificial intelligence team helping the department understand AI in education.
But Sheria Smith, union president for Department of Education career employees, told CNN the employees placed on paid leave had attended a two-day diversity training seminar in 2019 during the first Trump administration “that was required for senior-level employees and strongly encouraged for others,” as well as similar training under the Biden administration.
Others affected had either participated in a one-day lunch training on DEI or had volunteered with an agency group or committee that plans programs such as Black History Month celebrations.
The diversity training for Education Department employees was encouraged during the first Trump administration under then-Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, whose goal was for 400 employees to attend the sessions, according to the union.
Because of the large participation in the 2019 training seminar, the union is worried that hundreds more Department of Education staffers could be affected.
“We've filed several requests for information with the agency to get a clear understanding of what's happening and how many employees overall will be impacted,” Smith told CNN, but the union has not received any additional information.
CNN reached out to the Department of Education for comment but did not receive a response.
The New York Times first reported on the letters sent to Education Department employees informing them that they were being put on paid administrative leave.
The White House last month ordered government DEI employees to be placed on administrative leave and ended the use of DEI in hiring and federal contracting.
“The mission of the agency is stalled because this administration has forced these people to stop performing work for the American people,” Smith told CNN.
Agency leaders were also instructed to ask employees to report any efforts to “disguise these programs” in federal jobs and contract descriptions since the November election.

New York CNN — .
The DeepSeek drama may have been briefly eclipsed by, you know, everything in Washington (which, if you can believe it, got even crazier Wednesday).
But rest assured that over in Silicon Valley , there has been nonstop, Olympic-level pearl-clutching over this Chinese upstart that managed to singlehandedly wipe out hundreds of billions of dollars in market cap in just a few hours and put America's mighty tech titans on their heels.
ICYMI: DeepSeek is a Chinese AI lab with a model that's similar to ChatGPT, and people are freaking out over it because of its engineers' claims about how they built it — cheaply, using a small fraction of the computing power used by US labs like OpenAI.
Big picture: DeepSeek has forced tech bros and their investors to question the industry's core assumption that they need gajillions more dollars to effectively secure enough energy to power their AI advancements.
Now, perhaps not unexpectedly, American tech leaders are trying to shift the narrative to make DeepSeek look like the villain. (And you gotta suspect none of these guys — they're mostly guys — paid attention in English class because they appear fully unaware of the excruciating irony — some might say hypocrisy — baked into their accusations.) .
On Tuesday, Bloomberg and the Financial Times reported that OpenAI and Microsoft, its biggest investor, are looking into evidence that DeepSeek used OpenAI's intellectual property to build its competitor, violating its terms of service.
An OpenAI spokesperson confirmed to CNN on Wednesday that the company is “aware of and reviewing indications that DeepSeek may have inappropriately distilled our models, and will share information as we know more.” .
“Distilling” isn't exactly stealing , but it is a kind of copycat maneuver used by developers to train smaller AI models on the performance of larger, more sophisticated ones. (More on that in a moment.) .
CNN One Thing Trump's 'America First' Agenda Meets China's AI Advancement Wall Steet, Washington, and Silicon Valley are scrambling after a little-known Chinese startup claimed its artificial intelligence model can operate like ChatGPT at just a fraction of the cost.
We examine why the breakthrough could reverberate beyond the tech sector as President Donald Trump looks to counter China's influence.

...
So, to recap: OpenAI, a startup that's built on a foundation of data it scraped from the internet without permission , is pointing the finger at another startup allegedly doing… more or less the same thing.
As a reminder, OpenAI is currently mired in litigation with various content creators, including the New York Times , who accuse the company of training its large language models on copyrighted material. (OpenAI doesn't deny using the material but has argued that it's not copyright infringement because the content falls under the legal doctrine known as “fair use.”) .
The irony might have been best summed up in a headline from tech news site 404 Media: “OpenAI Furious DeepSeek Might Have Stolen All the Data OpenAI Stole From Us.” .
Some prominent tech figures greeted the allegations from OpenAI with a shrug, noting that distilling is practically standard practice in the AI industry.
“I'd be surprised if DeepSeek hadn't used it,” said Lutz Finger, senior visiting lecturer at Cornell University.
“Technically, it's easy to do,” he added, and “if done well, it is easy to disguise and avoid detection, thus I would be equally surprised if we ever get proof of such tactics.”.
Tech venture capitalist Bill Gurley wrote on X that “the core algorithm everyone uses was developed at DeepMind,” Google's AI lab.
“No one disputes that.
The vast majority of LLM insights and breakthroughs are 'borrowed.'
”.
So yeah, maybe OpenAI is having a bit of a sour grapes moment over a foreign rival making it look bad on the global stage.
Whatever.
The more generous read is that OpenAI, as the poster child of American AI innovation, is trying to establish some rules in what is an unregulated and rapidly expanding industry that few people outside of it understand at a technical level.
For example, there is a fine line between “distillation” and “extraction,” explains Zack Kass, an AI consultant and former OpenAI go-to-market lead.
“Distillation is a common practice in AI, but it's typically done within the same organization that owns both models,” he said in an email.
“If DeepSeek trained its model by querying ChatGPT at scale and using the responses to teach its own model, it raises legitimate concerns about whether that constitutes unauthorized use of OpenAI's API,” Kass said.
“Regardless of the specifics here, we're entering a phase where the AI community will have to define clearer norms around what constitutes fair use versus unauthorized replication.”.

CNN — .
Like most of us, Earth has a lot going on under the surface — even in what may have once seemed to be its most unassuming layer.
The mantle, a zone between our planet's thin crust and the molten core, features 1,800 miles (2,900 kilometers) of mostly solid rock, with a consistency like thickened caramel that scientists long hypothesized was uniformly blended.
But massive unmixed regions have been found lingering in the mantle, like lumps of chocolate in a cookie, and new findings are just beginning to reveal their secrets.
Among the enigmatic mantle lumps are two enormous “supercontinents” buried thousands of kilometers below the crust amid the remains of ancient tectonic plates.
One supercontinent lies under Africa, and the other resides deep under the Pacific Ocean.
Using a new method to analyze data from earthquakes, researchers recently uncovered previously unknown details about these vast island regions, revealing that they may serve as anchors in our planet's mantle and that they could be much older than previously thought.
The discovery adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that the rocky mantle isn't as well-stirred by Earth's internal churning as once believed.
And hidden structures or pockets of unblended material, such as these supercontinents, may shape mantle activity, including plate movement, in ways that are yet to be understood, scientists reported January 22 in the journal Nature .
“These findings will contribute to a better understanding of mantle convection and plate tectonics, and, therefore, phenomena we experience at the surface like earthquakes and volcanism,” said Claire Richardson , a doctoral candidate in the School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University, who was not involved in the new research.
“Resolving the physical, thermal, and chemical properties of rocks ~3000 km (1,864 miles) below our feet, at extreme temperatures and pressures, is a challenging problem to say the least,” Richardson told CNN in an email.
“Open questions abound, and each new study gets us closer to understanding what's really going on down there.”.
Researchers first spotted the subterranean supercontinents about 50 years ago when they popped up as anomalies in seismic data generated by earthquakes powerful enough to send reverberations through the planet.
When seismic waves encounter unusual structures in the mantle, changes in wave speed provide seismologists with clues about Earth's deep interior.
Over the decades, seismic data revealed that these supercontinents make up about 20% of the mantle-core boundary.
Each of the buried islands covers hundreds of thousands of miles, and in some spots they tower nearly 600 miles (965 kilometers) tall.
However, little was known about what they were made of, when they sank and what role they might play in mantle flow, known as convection, said Dr. Sujania Talavera-Soza , lead author of the new study and a geosciences and seismology researcher at Utrecht University in the Netherlands.
“Their origin and whether they are long-lived structures — it's widely debated,” Talavera-Soza said.
Earlier research focused on the velocity of seismic waves, showing that wave speed slowed by about 2% upon arriving at the supercontinents.
This slowing of seismic waves led geologists to name the regions large low shear velocity provinces, or LLSVPs.
Velocity loss in seismic waves suggested that these mantle zones were hotter than the rocks around them, Talavera-Soza said.
But it was unknown whether the LLSVPs differed structurally from nearby regions.
Scientists were also uncertain whether the supercontinents were actively involved in convection, or if they were “kind of dense piles that would just be sitting there,” said study coauthor Dr. Arwen Deuss , a professor of structure and composition of Earth's deep interior at Utrecht University.
“There was no information about that,” Deuss said.
“We only knew that seismic waves slowed down.”.
In the new study, the authors used a different approach for studying the LLSVPs to see if they could tease out details about the zones' composition and activity.
They looked at the attenuation, or intensity, of seismic signals as they traveled through the mantle to see how much energy the vibrations from quakes lost.
In music, attenuation is comparable to damping a tone, which produces a lower volume, Deuss said.
Examining the attenuation of the waves — along with changes in wave speed — could provide previously unseen clues about LLSVPs' makeup.
The best data for this is from waves produced by earthquakes that are magnitude 7.8 or higher, Talavera-Soza added.
Wave speed and energy loss were known to be affected by mineral grain size as well as temperature, so the authors used a physics model that linked seismology and mineral physics.
Waves are damped more when they encounter material made of smaller grains; if lots of grains are packed together, there are more boundaries between the grains that can sap a wave's energy.
Other studies revealed that the supercontinents had company in the deep mantle.
Around them were “ slab graveyards ” of sunken tectonic plates, Deuss said.
They were cooler than the LLSVPs, so seismic waves moved through them more quickly.
However, the new model showed that while seismic waves' velocity dipped when they reached LLSVPs, the waves didn't lose much energy.
By comparison, there was significant damping among the cooler graveyards around the LLSVPs.
Researchers believe those differences come down to the comparative ages of the structures.
Over millions of years, as rocky material descends through the boundary between the upper and lower mantle, mineral crystals are compressed and reformed into tinier grains that then regrow over time.
Younger regions therefore have smaller crystals, which suck more energy from seismic waves, so the amount of damping in a region hints at how old it is.
“The fact that the LLSVPs show very little damping, means that they must consist of much larger grains than their surroundings,” Talavera-Soza said.
Larger mineral grains suggested that the supercontinents were significantly older than the tectonic graveyards around them, as their grains must have had more time to grow, according to the study.
Larger building blocks would also make the supercontinents more rigid, keeping them separate from mantle convection, or movement of materials in that layer due to heat transfer.
“Our study points to the LLSVPs being long-lived features, at least half a billion years old, perhaps even older,” Talavera-Soza said.
“This implies they act as anchors at the base of the core-mantle boundary and have survived mantle convection, meaning that the mantle is not well-mixed.”.
This discovery follows another recent revelation about even more “sunken worlds” that contradict the notion of a blended mantle.
Buried plates in tectonic graveyards tend to accumulate in alignment with Earth's subduction zones — regions where the edges of two plates meet, and where one slides beneath the other.
But earlier this year, another team of scientists identified sunken tectonic slabs far from these boundaries in locations under continents' interiors and beneath oceans, where sunken plates had never been found before.
“Apparently, such zones in the Earth's mantle are much more widespread than previously thought,” said Thomas Schouten , lead author of that investigation and a researcher at the Geological Institute of ETH Zurich, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, in a statement .
The model in the new study — the first 3D attenuation model for the entire mantle — will help seismologists to better understand what lies thousands of kilometers below Earth's surface, said Richardson, the doctoral candidate.
“It maps regions of the Earth that weaken seismic energy, ultimately affecting the measurements many seismologists use to understand other physical and chemical properties of Earth's interior,” she said.
The findings could transform researchers' understanding of plate tectonics and how plate movement might be shaped by these ancient, fixed anchors near Earth's core, Deuss said.
Further analysis of the supercontinents could also reveal if they are the source of geochemical elements nearly as old as Earth itself that are found in lava from certain types of volcanoes, she added.
“These LLSVPs have been there for a long time — if they've been there for a billion years, they might have also been there for 4 billion years.
They might well be that hidden reservoir where these chemical primordial elements might be located.
We can't prove that now, but geochemists can investigate this,” Deuss said.
“From this study, I think there will be a lot of extra research that might answer a lot of outstanding questions that have been confusing scientists for ages.”.

Title: Chuck Todd is leaving NBC | CNN Business
# Chuck Todd is leaving NBC | CNN Business.
CNN — .
Chuck Todd, former moderator of NBC's “Meet the Press,” is leaving the network after nearly 20 years.
In an internal memo on Friday, Todd thanked his longtime colleagues and said he has a “few new projects” in the works, signaling a desire for a more entrepreneurial phase of his career.
For that reason, he said he is leaving the network a number of months before his NBC contract was set to expire.
Todd said NBC is allowing him to take his twice-a-week podcast franchise, “The ChuckToddcast,” to a new distributor.
For about a decade, Todd was one of the most prominent voices at NBC News, covering the political rise of Donald Trump and the Democratic response.
He helmed “Meet the Press” from 2014 until 2023.
Todd was outspoken about the corrosive impacts of Trump-era lies and indecency — and was ridiculed by Trump and others for it.
In 2023, after a management change atop NBC News, Todd stepped down from “Meet the Press” and Kristen Welker took over his role.
Todd said it was important not to “overstay” his welcome — a striking message for a Washington crowd full of elderly politicos.
“I'd rather leave a little bit too soon than stay a tad too long,” he added.
Todd saw his air time diminished in recent years, though he remained a prominent part of political and Election Night coverage last November.
In a statement on Friday NBC News said, “We're grateful for Chuck's many contributions to our political coverage during his nearly two-decade career at NBC News and for his deep commitment to 'Meet the Press' and its enduring legacy.
We wish him all the best in his next endeavors.”.
In his memo, Todd said, “The media has a lot of work to do to win back the trust of viewers/listeners/readers and I'm convinced the best place to start is from the bottom up,” with local instead of national media.
“This is a ripe moment,” he added.
“The only way to fix this information ecosystem is to stop whining about the various ways the social media companies are manipulating things and instead roll up our collective sleeves and start with local.”.

Title: Trump said he hadn't read Project 2025 - but most of his early executive orders overlap with its proposals | CNN Politics
# Trump said he hadn't read Project 2025 - but most of his early executive orders overlap with its proposals | CNN Politics.
CNN — .
President Donald Trump caught his own administration off guard last week by suggesting that the nation's primary disaster response agency might simply “go away.” .
Though Trump had routinely lambasted the Federal Emergency Management Agency throughout his third White House bid, he had stopped short of calling for its elimination.
Now, an executive order bearing his signature has put that possibility in motion.
The idea, however, wasn't new.
The contours of it circulated nearly two years ago through Project 2025, a sweeping plan to overhaul the government that Trump as a candidate forcefully disavowed.
Many of Trump's early actions appear closely aligned with Project 2025's plans.
A CNN analysis of the 53 executive orders and actions from Trump's first week in office found that more than two-thirds - 36 - evoke proposals outlined in “Mandate for Leadership,” Project 2025's 922-page blueprint for the next Republican president.
The overlap includes early steps taken by Trump to execute some of his most-touted pledges: cracking down on illegal immigration; dismantling diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives; and rolling back environmental restrictions on oil and gas exploration.
But the framework offered in “Mandate for Leadership” also foreshadowed some of Trump's more provocative and less expected early actions.
It calls for “quickly and aggressively” punishing countries that refuse deported migrants - as Trump did Sunday when Colombia blocked two US military planes carrying deportees.
It advises the president to “immediately revoke the security clearance” of top national security officials accused by conservatives of political bias, a move Trump executed within hours of taking office.
And Trump's directive to curb foreign aid from countries “not fully aligned” with his global aims appeases Project 2025's concern that these programs are “disconnected from the strategy and practice of U.S. foreign policy.”.
“This is exactly the work we set out to do,” Paul Dans, who oversaw Project 2025 at the conservative Heritage Foundation, told CNN in an interview Wednesday.
“It's still in the early first stages of bearing fruit, but we wanted to make sure the president was ready to hit the ground running on day one.
The rapidity and the depth of what they've rolled out this quickly is a testament to the work done in Project 2025 and other presidential transition projects.”.
The fraction of executive actions that so far do not touch on Project 2025 priorities include some of Trump's narrower fixations, like declassifying records on the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, requiring federal workers to return to the office and demanding the flag fly at full staff during presidential inaugurations.
In a statement to CNN, the White House picked up where Trump's campaign left off downplaying any connection between the Republican leader and the conservative playbook.
The president, his spokesman Harrison Fields said, “had nothing to do with Project 2025.” .
“In his first few days in office, President Trump has delivered on the promises that earned him a resounding mandate from the American people - securing the border, restoring common sense, driving down inflation, and unleashing American energy,” Fields said.
The Heritage Foundation declined to comment. .
Think tanks and advocacy organizations from both sides of the aisle typically prepare for incoming administrations with ready-made policy proposals.
But Project 2025 was significant for its breadth and coordination across the conservative movement.
The Heritage Foundation has found success influencing Republican administrations “through the back channels where a lot of Washington work happens” going back to President Ronald Reagan, said Heath Brown, a City University of New York professor who's written multiple books on presidential transitions.
The organization once boasted that Trump during his first year as president had implemented 64 percent of the 334 policies recommended in the 2016 version of “Mandate for Leadership.”
As Trump prepared for a third White House bid, he set the stage for Heritage's seminal work to inform his next administration's priorities once again.
“They're going to lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do,” Trump said during an April 2022 keynote address to the organization first unearthed by the Washington Pos t.
At least 140 former Trump administration officials and dozens of ardent allies ultimately wrote and contributed to “Mandate for Leadership.”
More than 100 friendly organizations endorsed it.
But by mid-2024, with Democrats seizing on Project 2025's more controversial proposals, Trump furiously sought to distance himself from what would become a deeply unpopular manifesto.
“I have nothing to do with Project 2025,” Trump said in the opening moments of his September debate against Vice President Kamala Harris.
“That's out there.
I haven't read it.
I don't want to read it, purposely.
I'm not going to read it.”.
Since his November victory, though, Trump has filled key government posts with people who helped put Project 2025 together.
Both Tom Homan, who is serving as White House border czar, and Trump's new CIA Director John Ratcliffe contributed to “Mandate for Leadership.”
Brendan Carr, named chairman of the Federal Communications Commission by Trump, wrote an entire chapter for Project 2025 on the agency he now leads.
Russ Vought, chosen as director of the Office of Management and Budget, authored a section on presidential power that appeared to preview the freeze on federal spending put in place this week by Trump's young government.
The president, Vought wrote for Project 2025, “should use every possible tool to propose and impose fiscal discipline on the federal government.
Anything short of that would constitute abject failure.”.
Dans, who stepped down from his position in July amid intensifying criticism of Project 2025 from Trump, said the first week of Trump's new term has been “gratifying” to watch.
He called the Democratic Party's “obsession” with Project 2025 - the subject of tens of millions of dollars in negative ads during the presidential race - an “epic electoral fail.”.
Democrats, though, continue to attack Trump over his ties to the conservative blueprint.
Since the election, the Democratic National Committee has sent more than 50 press releases that included the term “Project 2025.”.
Some of the synergy between Trump's early movements and Project 2025 reflect the expected harmony of a new Republican administration and a supportive right-wing group.
Indeed, a considerable share of the manifesto's voluminous policy plans are anchored in two consistent themes: unravel Joe Biden's presidency wherever possible and return to the policies of Trump's first term.
In Trump's first executive order after taking office, he revoked 67 of Biden's executive orders - including at least 15 singled out in “Mandate for Leadership.”.
Meanwhile, reinstating his first-term border policies - such as blocking federal grants to cities that don't comply with immigration enforcement - satisfied some of Project 2025's own immigration prescriptions.
But Trump also moved to restrict temporary protected status for those fleeing humanitarian emergencies, paused disbursements to non-profits assisting undocumented immigrants and mobilized the military to assist in border enforcement - all policies pushed by Project 2025.
“This is not a continuation of the first Trump administration.
It is substantially more aggressive, and he's doing a lot of the things we complained he didn't do in the first term,” said Ken Cuccinelli, the acting deputy secretary for the Department of Homeland Security under Trump who authored the Project 2025 section on his former agency.
The “general aggressiveness is certainly consistent” with what Cuccinelli wrote in Project 2025, he added, pointing especially to the deployment of the military and Trump's use of Department of Justice officers to assist in deportation.
As for FEMA, Cuccinelli in “Mandate for Leadership” urged the new administration to “shift the majority of preparedness and response costs to states and localities.”
The language is recognizable in the proposal Trump floated recently while touring North Carolina flood damage: “We're going to recommend that FEMA go away and we pay directly, we pay a percentage, to the state, and the state should fix it.”.
In his ensuing executive order, Trump launched a commission to review changes to FEMA, including whether the agency should be reformed to function only as a “support agency” to the states.
Michael Coen, a former FEMA chief of staff during the Obama and Biden administrations, said that while he had seen the Project 2025 proposal for the agency, it surprised him to hear Trump vocalize it.
“I never imagined it would be something that he would openly talk about,” Coen said.
“It does seem like there are people in the president's ear that are pushing what is in Project 2025 as far as their plan for FEMA.”.
Cuccinelli acknowledged he also hadn't expected Trump to embrace his proposal on FEMA.
In his first term, Trump relished his power awarding emergency relief to disaster-stricken areas.
“President Trump does love to show up and write checks, but I give him a lot of credit,” Cuccinelli said.
“He clearly recognizes that FEMA as a concept is failing.”.
Coen expects Republican governors and local officials will push back against this worldview.
“States across the country have come to rely on the federal government,” Coen said.
“It's hard to budget for if you're going to get a 500-year rain event that's going to wash away a town, and wash away your critical infrastructure.”.
Trump previewed many of his opening movements as president more than a year ago in a series of policy proposals published on a campaign website called “Agenda47,” such as ending subsidies for electric vehicles, limiting refugee programs and restoring a first-term directive allowing him to remove federal workers deemed insufficiently loyal.
Those ideas were separately backed by Project 2025's authors.
Trump's campaign website made clear he intended to reopen Alaska to drilling - which he did on his first day as president.
Project 2025 endorsed not only the move, but also the urgency.
“Alaska is a special case and deserves immediate action,” one section said.
Some of Project 2025's other priorities have been achieved indirectly through Trump's actions.
For example, a pending plan by the Biden administration for a ground and surface water limit on toxic PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, was withdrawn under Trump's day one freeze on new regulations.
A section on the Environmental Protection Agency in “Mandate for Leadership” encouraged the new president to “revisit the designation of PFAS chemicals as 'hazardous substances.'”.
Groups that had pushed for the Biden administration to crack down on PFAS - known as “forever chemicals” because they don't degrade in the environment - were well aware of the target placed on those regulations by Project 2025, said Melanie Benesh, vice president of governmental affairs at the Environmental Working Group.
There was some reason for optimism, Benesh acknowledged, when Lee Zeldin, Trump's EPA administrator, touted his past work tackling PFAS during his confirmation hearing.
But that hope dissipated when Trump's executive order effectively stalled Biden's planned crackdown.
“It calls into question the incoming administrator's commitment to taking on PFAS,” Benesh told CNN.
EPA spokeswoman Molly Vaseliou said it was “common transition procedure” to hold pending regulations when a new administration comes in.
“President Trump advanced conservation and environmental stewardship while promoting economic growth for families across the country in his first term and will continue to do so this term,” Vaseliou said.
As the administration moves forward, the extent to which Trump's actions run parallel to Project 2025 will remain a central question.
Some of Trump's early executive orders appear to lay the groundwork for future actions advocated by Project 2025.
For example, Trump's national energy emergency calls for a review of regulations protecting endangered and marine wildlife that may be “obstacles to domestic energy infrastructure.”
Project 2025 suggests the new administration move immediately to lift protections on grizzly bears and gray wolves and work with Congress on an overhaul of the Endangered Species Act.
Elsewhere, Trump has taken steps that seem to go beyond what Project 2025 has proposed.
Nowhere in the dozens of pages dedicated to a forceful crackdown on immigration do “Mandate for Leadership” authors suggest declaring the US is under invasion and designating Mexican drug cartels as terrorist groups, as Trump did in his executive orders.
Similarly, Trump exceeded Project 2025's calls to restart federal executions with an executive order expanding the potential crimes that could trigger the death penalty.
Still, not all of Project 2025's plans are necessarily included in the public manifesto.
The project's website acknowledged it intended to deliver the Trump transition a “playbook of actions” for the administration's first 180 days.
Neither Heritage nor the Trump White House would say if that exchange took place.
And in a hidden-camera video of Vought released last year , he said his group was drafting hundreds of potential orders, regulations and memos for Trump.
“With immigration in particular, executive orders aren't necessarily the thing that makes policy change,” said Dara Lind, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, an advocacy group for immigrants.
“What's been notable from the first nine days or so is not just that they had the executive orders ready to go on day one,” but other technical regulations and declarations on hand as well.
“That kind of timeline indicates a certain amount of preparation before getting into office,” she said.
Dans noted Project 2025 also engaged in a nationwide search for Trump loyalists to fill federal agencies with people who would execute his agenda.
“It all comes down to implementation,” Dans said, “And Project 2025 was ultimately about putting in place the people who would come in from outside the swamp and make changes.”.
On at least one issue, Trump is already spurning Project 2025: the future of TikTok.
Trump in an executive order paused a ban on the Chinese social media app, which Project 2025 described as a national security imperative.
Trump also recently said he was “ very unlikely ” to limit abortion pill access.
Project 2025 not only pushes for the administration to reverse federal approval of the abortion pill mifepristone, it also proposes excluding the morning-after pill and men's contraceptives from coverage mandated under the Affordable Care Act.
Trump has, though, moved to restrict federal funding for abortions both domestically and abroad, a stance that also appears in Project 2025's policy framework.
And his nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., told a Senate hearing Wednesday that Trump asked him to “study the safety” of mifepristone.
CNN's review of Trump's executive actions covered the first week of his new term, from his swearing in until noon on Monday.
In the days since, he has remained active, restricting certain treatments for transgender minors, keeping transgender adults out of the military and reinstating servicemembers who were discharged for refusing COVID vaccinations.
Each of those moves had support in Project 2025.

# Tech giants ramp up the battle against online hate speech in Europe.
At home, some are pulling back | CNN Business.
New York CNN — .
Two of America's Big Tech companies are opening the door to more “free expression,” even if it means more hateful content.
But in Europe, Big Tech companies are voluntarily cracking down.
It's a reminder of just how divergent Europeans' and Americans' online experiences are becoming, as EU lawmakers forge ahead with tech safety and accountability legislation against an industry widely seen as too big and too out of control, while such proposals have languished, if not faced active resistance, on Capitol Hill.
Tech platforms including Meta's Facebook and Instagram, X, Snapchat, TikTok, Twitch, LinkedIn and YouTube this week signed onto an updated European Union code of conduct promising to do more to combat online hate speech, which is often illegal in European countries.
Meanwhile, two of those same platforms — Meta and X — have made changes in the United States that they acknowledge could usher in more hateful speech, arguing that such changes promote freedom of speech and combat censorship.
And across the industry, companies have shrunk teams whose entire job was to ensure the safety of their platforms, including from people who seek to foment hate and violence.
The contrast is striking.
As part of the EU agreement, the companies agree to allow “monitoring reporters” — non-profits or public organizations with expertise on hate speech — to review their platforms and to act quickly on most of the content they flag, the European Commission said Monday.
The new code of conduct is voluntary, but tech companies can use their compliance to demonstrate that they are meeting obligations legally required by the EU's Digital Services Act (DSA) , which, among other things, mandates Big Tech platforms take meaningful steps to reduce illegal and harmful content.
“In Europe there is no place for illegal hate, either offline or online,” Henna Virkkunen, the commission's executive vice president for tech sovereignty, security and democracy, said in a statement, adding that the commitments will help “ensure a safe digital space for all.”.
It's one of a number of differences in US versus EU tech users' online experiences that have accumulated over time, Isabelle Wright, director of technology and society at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, told CNN.
“I think we've been heading in this direction for a while, but not just for hate speech, I think really for all categories of harm that most (other) Western nations cover in in their tech regulation,” Wright said.
“It's going to lead to an incredibly fractured information ecosystem between the US and essentially every other Western democracy.”.
Meta and X did not respond to requests for comment.
To be sure, Silicon Valley's efforts have always been far from perfect.
Meta's platforms have been accused of playing a key role in the organization of the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol and abetting genocide in Myanmar.
And across the tech world, efforts to address harmful content like hate speech have always been targeted, at least to some extent, at placating advertisers obsessed with “brand safety,” terrified at the thought that their ads could be placed next to a comment section awash in inflammatory remarks and threats of violence.
With advertising being the prime revenue generator for social media companies, the tastes of advertisers has historically set the tone.
But now even those efforts have been scaled back in the United States.
Elon Musk-owned X has seen an uptick in hate speech in recent years as it welcomed previously banned White supremacists and conspiracy peddlers back to the platform.
Musk himself has also boosted racist conspiracies on the site.
And Meta earlier this month announced several major content moderation policy changes in the United States, including scaling back its automated systems for removing content that violates its policies.
The systems will now be focused on checking only for illegal and “high-severity” violations such as terrorism and child sexual exploitation.
Meta also updated its hateful conduct policy to roll back protections for certain groups, including women and LGBTQ+ people.
Users of Meta's platforms will now, for example, be able to refer to women as household objects and suggest that transgender people are mentally ill, without fear that their comments will be removed or restricted by Facebook's moderation team. (A Meta spokesperson noted that the company would continue to prohibit slurs, as well as attacks against certain groups, such as those based on ethnicity, race and religion.).
Terms of Service with Clare Duffy How Do You Fact-Check Social Media?
Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg says the company is ending its partnership with third-party fact-checkers in the US because the program caused too much censorship on the company's platforms.
The announcement raised a big question: How much were third-party fact-checkers really responsible for what content stays or goes on Meta's platforms?

The platforms' US moves may reflect the changing American political environment, where many Republican leaders have equated content moderation with “censorship.” .
Members of the incoming Donald Trump administration, including the nominee to lead the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr, have also called for a reinterpretation of the tech immunity law Section 230.
In essence, they want tech companies to be protected from lawsuits over what their users post only if they do little-to-no content moderation whatsoever.
Following Meta's announcement earlier this month, Carr posted a gif of Jack Nicholson grinning and nodding in response to CNN's Brian Stelter post on X with the news about the tech giant's moderation policy.
When tech platforms announce changing policies or principles, Wright said, “the language they use to stand behind those indicates that they've put in, you know, a lot of a lot of thought and consultation into these processes.
Yet when an administration changes, those principles seem to change like the wind in order to better align with the people who could potentially regulate them or disrupt their businesses.”.
“I think what has become clear to the platforms is that the chances of any type of tech regulation in the US are slim to none,” Wright said.
But it isn't just hate speech where Americans have a different experience.
Europeans are protected in much broader ways, too.
Unlike Americans, Europeans are protected from having their personal demographic information, such as their race and political views, collected by tech companies without their consent, thanks to the General Data Protection Regulation .
Nor can Big Tech firms stop app developers from communicating cheaper, off-platform offers to users because of the Digital Markets Act .
The DSA also provides EU users with greater protections from targeted online ads.
And Europeans may have less access to AI tools, including products from Apple and Meta , because of privacy regulations and an EU law aimed at safe and responsible development of the technology.
But that divergence has the potential to become less pronounced as tech leaders have cozied up to Trump in the hopes that the new administration will advance their interests.
Zuckerberg and Musk, as well as Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and TikTok CEO Shou Chew, were all seated prominently at Trump's inauguration Monday.
Some of those Big Tech CEOs have already suggested they want Trump to pressure Europe into relaxing protections and regulations on the continent.
Cook is said to have raised the issue of European regulations in a meeting with Trump at Mar-a-Lago following the election.
And Zuckerberg has expressly said he will seek Trump's help in pushing back on safety rules from the EU and elsewhere.
In his policy announcement earlier this month, Zuckerberg said: “We're going to work with President Trump to push back on governments around the world that are going after American companies and pushing to censor more.”.

Title: Trump fires head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau | CNN Business
# Trump fires head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau | CNN Business.
New York CNN — .
President Donald Trump has fired Rohit Chopra, the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
Chopra received an email from the White House on Saturday morning informing him of the firing, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.
Chopra, who has been targeted by Republican lawmakers for putting restrictions on financial institutions in favor of consumers, announced his departure in a post on X on Saturday.
“This letter confirms that my term as CFPB Director has concluded.
I know the CFPB is ready to work with you and the next confirmed Director, and we have a great deal of energy to ensure continued success,” Chopra wrote .
The CFPB declined to comment on the news.
“It's the executive's decision and prerogative to see who they want in that role,” a White House official told CNN.
Major consumer banks including Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase are among companies facing lawsuits from the CFPB.
They, alongside tech industry leaders, have encouraged Trump to remove Chopra from his role — which was made possible by a 2020 Supreme Court ruling that enabled presidents to fire CFPB directors.
Chopra was appointed in 2021 by former President Joe Biden to serve as director of the bureau that regulates financial agencies.
The director of the CFPB, who under law was to serve a five-year term, also serves as a board member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, voting on key banking regulations.
Chopra will no longer be serving in that role either.
In his time at the CFPB, Chopra spearheaded controversial regulation limiting overdraft fees banks can charge as well as late fees credit card companies could collect from customers.
The rule intending to cap credit card late fees at $8 was later struck down by a federal judge.
The CFPB rule on overdraft fees, which would cap them at $5 — a substantial savings from the $35 that customers are typically charged — was finalized at the end of last year but is likely to face legal challenges , as well.
Under Chopra's leadership, the CFPB also finalized a rule making personal data more accessible so that it is easier to switch banks.
Before Trump took office this month, the agency finalized a rule that would remove about $49 billion in medical bills from credit reports.
“People who get sick shouldn't have their financial future upended,” said Chopra in a statement on January 7.
The consumer watchdog agency was created after the 2008 financial crisis by way of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.
The agency was the brainchild of Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who began advocating for it in 2007 when she was a Harvard Law School professor.
Warren, the ranking member of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, applauded Chopra for “holding Wall Street accountable for cheating hard-working families,” she said Saturday in a statement.
Despite their differences with Trump, Warren and several progressive lawmakers, including Sen. Bernie Sanders, have signaled their support for the president's campaign promise to temporarily cap credit interest rates at 10% — less than half of current rates according to Federal Reserve data.
To fulfill this promise, Warren said Trump “needs a strong CFPB and a strong CFPB director,” adding that “if President Trump and Republicans decide to cower to Wall Street billionaires and destroy the agency, they will have a fight on their hands.”.

Title: Trump's FCC is investigating NPR and PBS stations over sponsorships | CNN Business
# Trump's FCC is investigating NPR and PBS stations over sponsorships | CNN Business.
CNN — .
Brendan Carr, the Federal Communications Commission's new chairman, on Wednesday ordered an investigation into the sponsorship practices of NPR and PBS member stations.
In a letter obtained by CNN, Carr said he was “concerned that NPR and PBS broadcasts could be violating federal law by airing commercials.” .
“In particular, it is possible that NPR and PBS member stations are broadcasting underwriting announcements that cross the line into prohibited commercial advertisements,” Carr wrote in the letter, which was sent to NPR chief executive Katherine Maher and PBS president and chief executive Paula Kerger.
NPR and PBS programming is aired to a network of around 1,500 member stations, all of which choose which programs to broadcast.
The stations require licenses approved by the FCC to operate, and these licenses limit them as non-commercial educational broadcast stations, which are prohibited by federal law from airing advertisements.
The FCC's investigation will probe the underwriting announcements and policies of NPR and PBS, as well as their broadcast stations.
In a statement , Maher emphasized that the radio broadcaster and its member stations have complied with FCC regulations.
“We are confident any review of our programming and underwriting practices will confirm NPR's adherence to these rules,” Maher wrote.
PBS, likewise, defended its compliance with FCC standards, saying in a statement that it has worked “diligently to comply with the FCC's underwriting regulations.”.
Carr also sent the letter to congressional lawmakers, noting the investigation “may prove relevant to an ongoing legislative debate” over whether “to stop requiring taxpayers to subsidize NPR and PBS programming.”.
“To the extent that these taxpayer dollars are being used to support a for profit endeavor or an entity that is airing commercial advertisements, then that would further undermine any case for continuing to fund NPR and PBS with taxpayer dollars,” he wrote.
The investigation was first reported by the New York Times .
The FCC's probe echoes President Trump's attacks on news organizations whose reporting he takes issue with.
Last week, the FCC chair reversed eleventh-hour decisions from his predecessor, Jessica Rosenworcel, to dismiss complaints that had been brought against local CBS, ABC and NBC stations.
Notably, Rosenworcel also dismissed a complaint that had blocked a Philly-based Fox division's license renewal — a decision Carr did not reverse.
“We don't have the luxury of doing anything other than making very, very clear that this agency and its licensing authority should not be weaponized in a way that is fundamentally at odds with the First Amendment,” Rosenworcel wrote in a January 16 statement. .
Trump's ire against the press is nothing new — as part of his retaliation against those who he believes have wronged him .
On the campaign trail, he repeatedly took aim at news publishers.
For example, in March , Trump slapped ABC News and George Stephanopoulos with a lawsuit that the Disney-owned broadcaster eventually settled for $15 million .
And in November , Trump sued CBS over the network's “60 Minutes” interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris.
CNN's October review of Trump's speeches and social media posts found that over the past two years, he has called for every major American TV news network to be punished.
Just two days after reassuming the presidency, Trump took aim at MSNBC in a Truth Social post .
“MSDNC is even worse than CNN,” Trump wrote.
“They shouldn't even have a right to broadcast — Only in America.”.

Title: Women's college basketball greats Caitlin Clark and A'ja Wilson's collegiate jerseys retired | CNN
# Women's college basketball greats Caitlin Clark and A'ja Wilson's collegiate jerseys retired | CNN.
CNN — .
Caitlin Clark and A'ja Wilson , who both helped elevate the game of women's college basketball, had their respective No. 22 jersey retired Sunday at the schools where they became bona fide superstars.
Clark, the all-time leading scorer in NCAA men's and women's Division I basketball history, had her jersey raised to the rafters at Carver-Hawkeye Arena in Iowa City, Iowa, after the Iowa Hawkeyes' 76-69 upset win against the No. 4 USC Trojans.
Clark thanked her former teammates who were in attendance for the ceremony.
“I'm pretty overwhelmed right now,” the West Des Moines, Iowa, native told the sold-out crowd.
“I wouldn't be here without any of you and a lot of you came back.
You all have busy schedules and that just speaks to the culture of this place, so selfless.
I know my number is up there, but it wouldn't be if it weren't for all of you.”.
Clark led Iowa to two consecutive national title games.
In her senior season, she led the nation in scoring (31.6 per game) and assists (8.9 per game)..
She also showed some love to her former head coach and everyone who has supported her throughout her career.
“There wasn't many people when I first signed here when I said, 'I wanted to take this place to the Final Four' that they kind of laughed at me and Coach (Lisa Bluder) was literally the only person that agreed with me, thank God, or else we probably wouldn't be here.
I'm just very lucky and fortunate.”.
Clark added: “To all the people that just poured into me over the course of my career, from the people that don't get any recognition, from our media team, to our managers, all of you that have given so much of yourselves to allow me to be who I am, thank you.
I can't say it enough.
I wouldn't be here without all of you.”.
The 23-year-old is the only Division I player, man or woman, to lead her conference (Big Ten) in scoring and assists in four consecutive seasons.
She was selected to the All-Big Ten first team four times in four years, the first to ever do so in program history.
The Indiana Fever picked her with the No. 1 overall selection in the 2024 WNBA draft.
The National Player of the Year capped off a historic career at Iowa by having a groundbreaking year in her first season in the league.
Clark won the 2024 Rookie of the Year award in a near-unanimous vote.
## A'ja Wilson: 'I am overwhelmed with gratitude and joy' .
Wilson got very emotional as her jersey was lifted to the Colonial Life Arena's rafters in Columbia, South Carolina, before No. 2 Gamecocks' 83-66 victory over the Auburn Tigers.
“I am overwhelmed with gratitude and joy to have my jersey retired at the University of South Carolina, the place where my dreams began is an honor I can hardly put into words,” the school's first four-time All-American and National Player of the Year in 2018 told the Gamecock faithful.
“Columbia, South Carolina, is my home and it shaped me not just as an athlete but as a person.
As I would look up in the in the rafters and see my jersey, I'm reminded how important it is to chase your dreams without fear.”.
South Carolina's all-time leading scorer still currently holds 22 school records.
Wilson led the Gamecocks to their first Southeastern Conference (SEC) tournament title, first NCAA Final Four and first NCAA national championship.
She is also the first player in SEC history to win the Player of the Year three times.
The 28-year-old expressed gratitude to the “incredible” fans and South Carolina head coach Dawn Staley for their support.
“You fill this arena with energy and passion, making every game an unforgettable experience.
It's a privilege to be a Gamecock, to be a part of this community and one of the greatest honors of my life was representing Garnet and Black every night.”.
She continued: “Thank you coach for seeing the light in me even when I couldn't see it in myself and for showing me that it's not about the destination but the journey and the people you meet along the way.”.
Wilson was the top overall selection in the 2018 WNBA draft by the Las Vegas Aces as she became the first South Carolina player to accomplish that feat.
Wilson was unanimously selected 2018 WNBA Rookie of the Year.
In 2021, South Carolina honored Wilson with an 11-foot bronze statue outside the main entrance of the arena.
Last season, Wilson was unanimously named the WNBA MVP, her third time winning the award and set the record for the most points in a WNBA season .
The No. 22 jersey will never be worn by any women's college basketball player at Iowa or South Carolina.

Title: Summary of 2025 Grammys: Artists show support for LA and more great moments | CNN
# Summary of 2025 Grammys: Artists show support for LA and more great moments | CNN.
CNN — .
The 2025 Grammys had a tough task.
Music's biggest night took place in Los Angeles, just weeks after wildfires left unprecedented destruction across the city.
Instead of looking away, the award show chose to use the platform and captive audience for good and a lot of singing and dancing along the way.
At the top of the show, host Trevor Noah said that instead of just celebrating music, the ceremony would be “a celebration of the humanity and spirit of survival.”
And that it was.
Here's some of highlights of the ceremony, including, yes, Beyoncé's big win:.
They finally said her name.
Beyoncé won the Grammy for album of the year for her genre-bending “Cowboy Carter,” capturing an elusive first win in the category after four previous nominations over the course of her highly-decorated career.
Presented to her by members of the Los Angeles Fire Department, Beyoncé accepted the award while standing next to her daughter, Blu Ivy.
“I just feel very full and very honored,” she said.
“It's been many, many years.”.
Lady Gaga and Billie Eilish were seen with tears in their eyes watching from the crowd.
The win was Beyoncé's third of the night.
The Grammy Awards' love for the City of Angels began with an opening act that brought Altadena natives Dawes to the stage with Sheryl Crow, Brad Paisley, John Legend, Brittany Howard and St. Vincent for an unforgettable cover of Randy Newman's “I Love L.A.” And it didn't end there.
Commercial time was given to local businesses affected by last month's wildfire, with famous faces making cameos.
Noah directed viewers to a QR code on the screen to raise money for MusiCares Fire Relief and other charities - $7 million was raised during the show, he announced near the end of the broadcast.
LA-native Billie Eilish performed her hit “Birds of a Feather” in a rustic setting reminiscent of the hiking trails throughout LA County, while what appeared to be childhood photos showed in the background.
Later, Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars took the stage to perform a pared down cover of the 1965 song “California Dreamin'” by The Mamas & the Papas, following a pre-taped piece that highlighted harrowing images of damaged homes and heartbroken families.
Gloomy?
At times, but the show's main message was one of hope and an invitation to join those finding ways to usher in better days.
The task of striking the right tone for the night rested upon the capable shoulders of comedian Noah.
The five-time host knew when to have fun and when to let the moment breathe.
Speaking of the relief efforts, Noah said, “You know, it's often said that in the darkest times, the best of humanity shines through.”.
With ease and an authentic charm, Noah, too, shined.
Let's be clear: Speeches are hard.
But this year's Grammy winners came prepared.
Doechii, winner for best rap album, was among those who took the stage with a heartfelt message that acknowledged her position in history as only the third female to win the award. (Lauryn Hill and Cardi B were the others.).
“I put my heart and my soul into this mixtape,” she said.
“I bared my life.
I went through so much.
I dedicated myself to sobriety and God told me that I would be rewarded.”.
She concluded her speech with words of inspiration.
“I know that there is some Black girl out there, so many Black women out there, that were watching me right now and I want to tell you.
Anything is possible,” she said. “
Don't allow anybody to project any stereotypes on you that tell you you can't be here, that you're too dark or that you're not smart enough or that you're too dramatic or you're too loud.
You are exactly who you need to be to be right where you are and I am a testimony.”.
Beyoncé, winner for best country album for “Cowboy Carter,' also brought a message of empowerment, prior to her win for album of the year.
“I think sometimes genre is a cold word to keep us in our place as artists,” she said.
“And I just want to encourage people to do what they're passionate about and stay persistent.”.
Later, best new artist winner Chappell Roan stood up for emerging artists, calling on record companies to provide living wages and health care for rising artists.
She's been in their shoes, she said.
“It was so devastating to feel so committed to my art and feel so betrayed by the system and so dehumanized to not have help,” she said, adding, “Labels, we got you, but do you got us?”.
Honorees didn't steer away from political subjects, with Shakira dedicating her fourth career Grammy to immigrants, Lady Gaga speaking in support of the LGBTQ community and Alicia Keys addressing recent attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion programs.
“DEI is not a threat; it's a gift,” she said.
Best new artist nominee Raye may soon join the ranks of other musicians known by a singular name after her memorable performance.
With strings and horns section behind her, she sang a rendition of her song “Oscar Winning Tears,” closing out a series of performances by those nominated in that category - including Doechii, Benson Boone, Teddy Swims and Khruangbin.
Later, in a tribute to the late producer and musician Quincy Jones, introduced by Will Smith, “Wicked” star Cynthia Erivo performed a sublime version of “Fly Me To the Moon,” the hit standard Jones produced for Frank Sinatra in 1964.
Lainey Wilson, Herbie Hancock, Stevie Wonder and more joined in the tribute.
Wonder praised Jones' generosity and the work he did to produce “We Are the World.”.
Also, shoutout to Shakira, whose hips and abs still don't lie but do defy the laws of nature.

Title: Trump says banning TikTok won't make Americans safer from China.
He may have a point | CNN Business
# Trump says banning TikTok won't make Americans safer from China.
He may have a point | CNN Business.
New York CNN — .
President Donald Trump on Wednesday batted down the national security concerns surrounding TikTok, saying, “Is it that important for China to be spying on young people?
On young kids watching crazy videos?”.
It was a surprising comment coming from the guy who first tried to ban TikTok from the United States over worries that the Chinese government could use the app to gather intelligence on Americans.
In his 2020 executive order that unsuccessfully tried to ban the app, Trump said TikTok's data collection could allow China's government “to track the locations of Federal employees and contractors, build dossiers of personal information for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage.” .
Since Trump's 2020 executive order , US lawmakers have largely agreed that it poses a risk.
State and federal government agencies and the military have restricted staff from downloading the app on their work devices, beginning during Trump's first term.
And last year, Congress passed a law with bipartisan support requiring parent company ByteDance to sell TikTok to a non-Chinese owner or face a ban, which the Supreme Court upheld on national security grounds.
But Trump's comment about data security — while dramatically oversimplified — may have some merit.
Some privacy and technology experts say simply transferring control of TikTok to a new owner won't be a silver bullet to protect US users' data from China, given that Beijing has plenty of other avenues for accessing information about Americans.
Other social media platforms and websites collect similar data to TikTok — such as location data, search history and purchase history — and many other sites sell that data to data brokers, which make it available online for any willing buyer.
“The Chinese government can simply buy US user data from data brokers.
It is widely available,” Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told CNN's “Terms of Service” podcast earlier this month.
“If US lawmakers really cared about protecting American users' data from the Chinese government, they would pass comprehensive data privacy legislation that would limit what kind of data all companies can collect and what kind of data all companies can sell,” she said. (TikTok CEO Shou Chew testified before Congress in 2023 that the company does not sell to data brokers.) .
China also has advanced cyber-espionage capabilities that in just the past year have allowed the country to spy on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, the government office that reviews foreign investments for national security risk, as well as American telecom networks .
Data collection isn't the only concern surrounding TikTok.
US lawmakers worry that the Chinese government could force ByteDance to manipulate the TikTok algorithm , to spread Chinese propaganda or disinformation, or to sow discord among Americans. .
But even then, Chinese government actors have also successfully weaponized US-owned social media platforms to spread disinformation and harass Americans. (TikTok has also denied that Beijing would have access to manipulate its algorithm.) .
Still, contrary to Trump's point, TikTok is far more than just “young kids watching crazy videos.”
Around half of the US population — 170 million Americans — use the platform, often to discuss news, politics and world events.
Trump's comment may be aimed at garnering support for his proposal that, rather than a wholesale transfer of US TikTok to an American buyer, the United States and China could share control of the platform as a 50-50 joint venture.
It's unclear if that suggestion would satisfy the letter of the TikTok sale-or-ban law, which seeks to prevent a foreign adversary from controlling such a popular social media platform.
The reversal in Trump's stance on TikTok has raised questions about why he is apparently less concerned now about TikTok threatening US national security.
Trump has said he changed his mind because he “got to use it.” .
One explanation “could be that China is less powerful than it was five years ago.
Their economy isn't as strong as it used to be; internationally, they're less vocal and active and influential,” said Sarah Kreps, director of the Tech Policy Institute at Cornell University.
But, Kreps said, that alone “doesn't seem enough to me to explain why there was such a national security concern a few years ago and now this is kind of being waved off as not a concern,” especially given China's ongoing interest in and success in spying on Americans through other means, she said.
Still, whether TikTok's US operations are sold in part or entirely, it could be difficult — if not impossible — to ensure that Beijing no longer has any means of controlling it, given that the technology originated in China.
“Whether you have 25%, 50%, 99% American-owned, it's a legitimate question of whether from an engineering perspective, you can disentangle this Chinese control within the source code from TikTok itself,” Kreps said.
TikTok, for its part, has tried for years to assuage US concerns by storing American users' data in Oracle-owned servers in the United States, offering access for third-party monitors to review its systems and saying it could not be accessed by its China-based parent company even if Beijing officials demanded it — albeit unsuccessfully.
Although it may not be a perfect solution, some experts say the sale of TikTok — in its entirety — is still crucial for US national security because of the potential that China could use TikTok's trove of user data and manipulate the app's algorithm to target Americans with specific videos they might be inclined to believe or engage with.
Justice Brett Kavanaugh summarized that concern from Congress in the Supreme Court hearing earlier this month over TikTok's challenge to the sale-or-ban law, which the court shot down.
American lawmakers, Kavanaugh said, “were concerned that China was accessing information about millions of Americans, tens of millions of Americans, including teenagers, people in their twenties” and that the country could use that information “to turn people, to blackmail people — people who a generation from now will be working in the FBI or the CIA or in the State Department.”.
“I think that's where it gets really, truly dangerous from a national security perspective,” said Lindsay Gorman, managing director of the German Marshall Fund's technology program.
In theory, ByteDance, at the behest of China, could use “this incredibly powerful tool to influence Americans at the… individual level toward certain views and certain actions.”.

Title: I don't have diabetes, but I wore a glucose monitor for six weeks.
Here's what I learned about food (and anxiety) | CNN
# I don't have diabetes, but I wore a glucose monitor for six weeks.
Here's what I learned about food (and anxiety) | CNN.
CNN — .
One day in September, I stood in front of my open refrigerator, ravenous but unable to figure out what I should eat.
I was worried that whatever I chose to eat would cause the new app on my phone to record a spike in my glucose levels that would count against the number I was allowed that day - and I was determined to conquer this algorithm.
I'd just put on a continuous glucose monitor, a device that sticks to your arm and uses a tiny needle to provide near-real-time information about how much sugar is circulating in your blood - not because I have diabetes, the main use for what are called CGMs, but because these devices are starting to be marketed as wellness tools for everybody, and I wanted to see how they work.
Apple?
Too sugary.
Granola bar?
Hello, glucose spike.
Cheese - that's the ticket.
A few days of wearing this monitor had taught me that cheese would not cause my glucose to go up.
“Is this thing just inadvertently putting you on the keto diet ?” my husband - who'd witnessed a few episodes of hanger while I was trying to figure out how to please my CGM - finally asked.
Pretty much.
Avoiding carbohydrates and prioritizing protein and fat, often together, didn't lead to spikes in glucose that my CGM and app, Lingo from the health company Abbott, would count against me.
But because I wasn't aiming to switch to a very low-carb, ketogenic diet, I initially struggled to figure out what to eat; in the first week or so of wearing the CGM, my scale read my weight at 3 pounds lower than usual - a blip, I presume, because I was too nervous to eat normally.
This is not, unsurprisingly, how experts say CGMs should be used, whether you have diabetes or not.
Continuous glucose monitors have been revolutionary for people with type 1 diabetes, for whom glucose levels are life and death, providing information about how much insulin they need to inject to keep their blood sugar stable.
The alternative is finger-stick testing , pricking fingertips to draw drops of blood to check glucose levels, often multiple times a day.
“CGMs are life-changing for insulin-dependent diabetics,” said Laura Marston , an attorney and advocate for lower insulin prices who was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes as a teenager.
Before she got a CGM, she said, she'd go long periods without checking her glucose levels through finger-stick tests, instead adjusting her insulin doses based on how she was feeling, leading to hospitalizations with a dangerous condition known as diabetic ketoacidosis .
Now, Marston said, she knows her glucose level every five minutes with a CGM, and her A1C, another measure of glucose in the blood, is steadily at a much better level - something she attributes both to the CGM and to focusing more on dealing with diabetes and having steadier health insurance.
In that context, CGMs are medical devices, requiring prescriptions and - usually , but not always - receiving coverage through health insurance.
CGMs can be covered for people with type 2 diabetes who use insulin, as well.
But this year, Dexcom and Abbott , the two major makers of CGMs, introduced biosensors for people who don't use insulin, available without a prescription and for about $89 a month out of pocket.
Dexcom's offering, called Stelo, was cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration in March, based on data from a clinical study showing that the device performed similarly to other CGMs.
In an FDA release, Dr. Jeff Shuren, then director of the agency's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said that “CGMs can be a powerful tool to help monitor blood glucose” and that “giving more individuals valuable information about their health, regardless of their access to a doctor or health insurance, is an important step forward in advancing health equity for US patients.”.
Abbott's Lingo was cleared in June and is targeted specifically for “consumers who want to better understand and improve their health and wellness,” the company said in a news release.
The idea is that seeing near-instantaneous feedback to the glucose effects of food, exercise, sleep and stress might give people insights about unique ways their bodies react to different inputs and help them make changes to improve their health.
I was excited to try it.
Putting the device on was surprisingly painless, and an hour after the little disc was secured to my arm, I started seeing my glucose levels on the accompanying app on my phone.
“117,” I messaged Dr. Jody Dushay , a physician at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center who works with people with obesity and diabetes and who'd offered to review my CGM findings with me.
The Lingo app told me that was within what it called a “typical healthy glucose range” of 70 to 140 milligrams per deciliter, noting that “occasionally, you may find yourself over 140 mg/dL or under 70 mg/dL, which is expected.”.
Dushay had warned me before I put on the CGM that blood sugar could range from the high 50s when fasting to the 150s after eating in a generally healthy young woman.
She also emphasized that continuous glucose monitoring shouldn't be used to diagnose prediabetes or diabetes.
Her caution about how I might react to seeing my data turned out to be warranted.
In the first week I wore the monitor, I was glued to the app, watching my glucose rise shortly after eating.
The app accumulates metrics that it calls Lingo Counts to try to help users make sense of the data, with a higher number associated with a bigger or longer elevation of glucose.
Although the app gave me an initial target of 60 or under for my daily Lingo Count, I found myself trying to keep it as low as possible, a tendency reinforced by the app's suggestions to do 20 squats after lunch to “find some balance” as my count was going up.
I ended up keeping my count so low initially that the app reset my daily target to 22, which I exceeded frequently once some of my anxiety wore off.
And although the finding that cheese didn't lead to a glucose spike wasn't a huge surprise, there were a few other readings that were interesting.
A salad with chopped vegetables and quinoa that I thought was a healthy choice for a quick lunch registered one of my largest Lingo Counts of the week, probably because of the sugar in the peanut dressing.
A glass of wine and a slice of pizza, on the other hand, didn't cause a glucose surge - a happy revelation but not one that I can pretend will lead to better health.
“Your values are all completely normal,” Dushay told me when I sent her screengrabs of my glucose levels.
“What look like 'spikes' are perfectly fine excursions within the normal range.”.
But could those increases, even within a normal range, give me feedback on ways I could feel healthier?
Stay full longer?
Have more energy?
Lower my risk of metabolic disease?
Or would I learn only that, as Marston put it, my “pancreas functions as it should”?.
It depends on whom you ask; the scientific community appears to be divided on the value of continuous glucose monitoring for people who don't have diabetes, a gulf that researchers say is exacerbated by a lack of data.
There are “definitely a lot of strong opinions in the field,” said Dr. Nicole Spartano , an assistant professor at Boston University's Chobanian and Avedisian School of Medicine who studies CGM use in non-diabetic people.
Spartano said she conducted a study in which she surveyed clinicians who had expertise on CGMs and asked them to interpret about 20 reports on glucose levels in people without diabetes.
“There's no consensus about how they view the data,” she said.
“Some people think high spikes are bad; some people think they're meaningless in people without diabetes; some people think, 'if it's a prolonged period of a glucose excursion,'” over 180 or so, those people should be screened for diabetes;
“other experts will see that and say that person is fine.”.
Dr. Robert Lustig , professor emeritus of pediatrics in the Division of Endocrinology at the University of California San Francisco, who's written several books warning against excess sugar and processed foods, is in the camp that says keeping glucose down is crucial.
He argues that continuous glucose monitoring is useful for people without diabetes - if users get the right help interpreting their data.
“Not everybody responds to the same foods as everyone else,” said Lustig, who's an adviser to a company called Levels that offers continuous glucose monitoring along with an app.
“The goal is to keep your glucose down, because when you keep your glucose down, you keep your insulin down, and when you keep your insulin down, then the insulin is not there to drive energy into fat, and it's not there to cause cell growth, which is at the heart of chronic metabolic disease.” .
Lustig acknowledged that people using CGMs could experience the same anxiety I initially felt about the glucose data - but argued that anxiety could be lessened if users receive more help interpreting the information.
And Dushay and Spartano emphasized that it would be particularly important for people who have a history of disordered eating or other food anxiety to talk with health-care providers before using a CGM.
But for some, the devices provide surprising insights about how different people react to foods - like CNN's chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta , who's worn a CGM along with his wife, Rebecca.
Neither has diabetes, but they were curious about what they could learn to potentially improve their health.
“When I eat blueberries, my glucose will not spike at all,” he said.
“When she eats blueberries, her glucose will immediately spike.”.
With rice, he said, it's the opposite: His glucose spikes, while Rebecca's doesn't.
An Indian flatbread he's been eating since he was a kid also caused a major increase.
And sometimes, Gupta said, his glucose can go up to 180 milligrams per deciliter.
With a history of diabetes in his family, which he's discussed on his “ Chasing Life ” podcast, that's enough to make him want to avoid those foods.
After four weeks of wearing a CGM - each biosensor device lasts two weeks - I decided to take a break and formulate a better plan before I applied my third and final monitor.
I realized that the way I'd approached it the first time around was, as Dushay put it, “an artificial experiment”: I wasn't using the CGM to get feedback about how I normally eat; I was eating abnormally in immediate response to the CGM.
“Your first biosensor [should be] a look at what you've been doing over time, kind of what your body's been experiencing, even though you didn't have that peek behind the curtain,” said Pam Nisevich Bede , nutritionist for Abbott's Lingo business.
“And then you're starting to experiment with a few different food choices, timing of meals, et cetera.
And then with your next biosensor, you're going to be fine-tuning those habits.” .
I decided not to look at my glucose levels for the first week of wearing the final monitor, recording my food by hand and entering it into the app at the end of each day.
And in the second week, I'd try to make changes.
I also repeated some meals to measure whether my glucose response was consistent, as a National Institutes of Health study found significant variability in CGM readings even in the same person to the same food, according to its author, Dr. Kevin Hall , a senior investigator with the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.
I'd just baked banana bread with my kids, so I repeated that for breakfast a few times that week and generated a fairly consistent increase in glucose, registering a 10 on my Lingo Count one day and an 11 another.
On a third day, exercising afterwards blunted my Lingo Count by a few points.
Even so, my glucose never exceeded about 136 milligrams per deciliter, even at its highest after banana bread.
Swapping in Greek yogurt or chia pudding appeared to avoid accumulating Lingo Counts, although I'm not sure I needed a CGM to tell me those might be better choices than banana bread for breakfast.
One thing the CGM did do was nudge me to avoid snacking mindlessly, which may be the kind of small behavioral modification that can make a difference.
I didn't want to have to track every bite of graham cracker I indulged in during my kids' afternoon snack or to see the resulting increases in glucose on my app.
“I think there's a place for it in terms of behavioral management,” said Spartano, who's leading research into whether CGMs can predict the development of diabetes as part of the Framingham Heart Study .
“We're just really early in this research space.” .

Title: What this teenager wants you to know about the damaging effects of AI | CNN
# What this teenager wants you to know about the damaging effects of AI | CNN.
Editor's note: Mary Frances Ruskell is a senior at Heathwood Hall Episcopal School in Columbia, South Carolina.
CNN — .
My friend Sammy turned around at his desk and grinned at me.
He held out his phone and waved it in front of my face, the universal sign for “Look at this!”
It was a video of a capybara in a swimming pool, seemingly treading water like a human does, feet down and arms circling.
Last year, I would have believed the post I saw on that screen and accepted it as part of what I know to be true about the world: capybaras tread water like people.
Now, I wasn't sure.
Even though teens spend so much of our lives online, a new study by Common Sense Media found that teens between the ages of 13 and 18 increasingly do not trust the content they consume online.
With the emergence of generative AI — a type of artificial intelligence that produces content such as images, text and videos — it has become easy to quickly produce fake visual content.
My friends and I have noticed these AI-generated images flooding social media platforms.
### What's real and what's not? .
Many teens struggle to figure out what online content is real and what is fake, according to the study.
Some 46% said they either know that they have been misled by content or suspect that they have been, while 54% have seen visual content that “was real, but misleading.”.
Collected by Ipsos Public Affairs on behalf of Common Sense Media from March to May 2024, the survey data is from a nationally representative survey that includes responses from 1,045 American adults (age 18 or older) who are parents or guardians of one or more teens age 13 to 18, and responses from one of the teenage children in each of those parents' families.
Maybe the teens who reported that they haven't been misled are just absolute aces at spotting fake images, but I wonder if they just haven't realized that they have, in fact, been swindled by AI images.
“Many kids don't see flaws that they aren't trained to detect,” said Robbie Torney, Common Sense Media's senior director of AI programs, in an email.
“Knowing that the media we consume can be retouched, modified, or even fake, it's crucial that we all learn to think critically about information we encounter.”.
I think that I'm generally pretty good at spotting AI images, but there was once a time when I believed that I couldn't be fooled.
That was mostly in the early days of generative AI, when people in AI-generated photos typically had 15 fingers.
But I no longer think I can't be fooled.
More than 70% of the surveyed teens who have experienced deceptive visual content reported it has changed how they view the accuracy of content.
I'm part of that group now.
After a few too many cool posts of alleged historical pictures that turned out to be fake, I generally distrust most pictures I see if they are not posted by someone I know.
I examine the fingers of any human picture first, since I know AI can still get the number of human fingers wrong.
I have begun checking the comments of nearly every post I come across to see whether other users believe it.
Doubt in the back of my mind now colors my response to everything I look at, and what I think.
Since third grade, I have been warned about checking sources and not believing everything you read.
I have been generally distrustful of information from the internet for years, so AI has not suddenly damaged my trust in online information.
What has changed is my trust in images.
Seeing is not believing anymore.
I used to accept photos as fact.
Before AI, there were programs people used to photoshop images, but those images are still real images of real people, just tweaked.
Colors could be changed, and things could be cut out — but the original photo was an image of real life.
As generative AI improves, however, completely fake content is getting harder for me to spot.
One of the primary ways that my friends and I communicate is with images and videos.
Memes are their own form of communication.
Sharing an Instagram post about some weird scientific fact or interesting historical photo shows you know what a friend would find interesting.
Sending someone funny video clips is a form of affection.
It tells someone you remember them and lets you share an inside joke.
While I'm no longer a heavy social media user, I still probably see hundreds of images a day online.
Other teens who spend more time on Instagram than I do or who use TikTok might see thousands.
If those “photos” are just images cobbled together by a machine, wholly detached from anything real, what can I believe?
I already doubt everything I read online.
This mistrust is spreading into teens' offline lives.
Studies show that teens already have low trust in institutions such as the government and news media.
Doubt in the world around us is rampant among my friends.
It's common for me to hear dismissive statements thrown around, even about the textbooks we read in class.
I've heard refrains like “Eh, maybe they did that,”
“Might be true,” and “I don't believe that” thrown out about anything and everything.
My classmates and I often doubt the news, history and authority figures.
If teens can no longer trust what they read, hear or see online, why should they trust anything?.
In a generation in which mistrust could very well become the default approach to life, what can a person rely on?
Or hope for?
What's the point of caring about anything, if it could all be false?
One of my teachers thinks that members of Generation Z (born between 1997 and 2012) are nihilists , whether they know it or not.
My friends and I struggle with these questions, and I think my teacher may be right.
How does this get fixed?
The Common Sense study found that 74% of teens agree that generative AI “should have visible warnings that its outputs could be harmful, biased, or wrong.”
And 73% of teens want content generated by AI “to be labeled or watermarked” to show its source.
I believe this demand is because we're losing ground in what we can believe.
I wish that I could trust what I see, and AI-generated content being required to be marked as fake is a reassuring idea.
“The growing mistrust in AI mirrors historical challenges with media literacy,” Torney said via email.
“Just as we learned to evaluate traditional media by asking 'who created this?' and why was it made?', we must now apply these same critical thinking skills to AI-generated content.”.
It's a good solution, no doubt.
But it still means that we cannot initially trust what we see.
Instead, we must examine it, question it, and have faith in ourselves that we've come to the right conclusion.
People say that social media and increased time online is making us lonely because of the absence of physical connection.
And maybe that's part of the deep loneliness, and the increasing anxiety and depression we know teenagers today report.
But if this loss of trust continues, I think we'll become even more individualistic and form shallower connections with each other.
If mistrust becomes the default approach to life, what would be the point of doing anything for other people that you don't already know?
Will we be able to get to know each other deeply, or successfully communicate?.
Can you really build a life when you don't know what is real and what is fake, when you can never trust what you see, what you learn, or how the world works?.
Artificial intelligence is just that: artificial.
When some of the main tools you use as a teenager to connect with real friends — memes and social media — are corrupted with artificiality, how do you make real connections?
When the main way teenagers learn about the bigger world outside of their schools and towns is the internet, can we ever understand the world?.

Title: Santorini in Greece hit by 200 earthquakes, sparking school closures | CNN
# Santorini in Greece hit by 200 earthquakes, sparking school closures | CNN.
Athens CNN — .
Schools will be closed Monday on the iconic Greek island of Santorini after a series of 200 earthquakes shook the popular tourist destination in recent days.
Authorities have also advised residents to avoid large indoor gatherings and steer clear of multiple ports, including the old port of Fira, just below the island's capital.
Schools will also be shut in the nearby Aegean islands of Anafi, Ios and Amorgos, authorities said Sunday.
Between Friday and Sunday, more than 200 earthquakes were detected between Santorini and Amorgos, including a 4.6-magnitude quake, the most powerful so far, according to authorities.
Santorini is no stranger to earthquakes , sitting as it does on several fault lines.
The risk of tremors doesn't stop a reported 3.4 million people from visiting the island each year - far outnumbering Santorini's 20,000 or so residents.
The holiday destination, famed for its crescent-shaped caldera, which was created by one of the largest known volcanic eruptions around 3,600 years ago, has been dubbed Greece's “Instagram island” due to its photogenic golden light and sweeping scenery.
An emergency committee met Sunday to assess the risks posed by the latest tremors, while another meeting is scheduled for Monday.
Santorini is part of the Hellenic Volcanic Arc, one of the most active volcanic fields in Europe, which has seen more than 100 eruptions over the past 400,000 years.
Authorities said current seismic activity is due to tectonic movements that do not appear related to volcanic activity.
Similarly, increased seismic activity in 2011 and 2012 did not result in any eruptions, they noted.
The most recent large quake in Santorini struck on July 9, 1956.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake was followed by a 25-meter-high (around 80 feet) tsunami.
At least 53 people were killed and more than 100 injured, while at least one-third of the houses collapsed.

Title: Big changes at Starbucks roll out Monday | CNN Business
# Big changes at Starbucks roll out Monday | CNN Business.
New York CNN — .
Changes at Starbucks might remind customers of the chain of the old.
Beginning Monday, several policies are returning to Starbucks' locations in United States and Canada — part of CEO Brian Niccol's Herculean task of reversing sales and traffic declines at the struggling institution.
The chain is bringing back condiment bars after they were taken away during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic , and baristas will return to hand-writing customers' names on their cups using Sharpies.
Both changes are part of Starbucks' plans to reboot the coffee house vibe that's diminished in recent years.
The return of milk and sugar stations are a small step for Starbucks, but it represents something much bigger for the world's largest coffee chain.
It's an acknowledgment that Starbucks went too far in overloading its baristas with endless ways to prepare drinks.
Niccol said in a previous earnings call that “our customers are asking for it and our baristas are saying it would help them deliver the speed of service that they want to provide.”.
The return of personalizing cups is also a Niccol directive, who previously said the chain has to “track down” 200,000 Sharpies to make it happen.
Starbucks released a new TV advertisement promoting the personal touches that comes with handwritten notes, as well as a slight name update to “Starbucks Coffee Company.” (The company didn't immediately respond to CNN's request for comment about the branding change.) .
Also, free refills on some “for here” orders are expanding to all of its paying customers — a perk that was once reserved for members of its loyalty program.
They will be served in ceramic mugs or a clean personal cup brought from home and are eligible for hot or iced coffee and tea orders.
In addition, Starbucks isn't letting anyone hang out or use its restrooms without making a purchase.
The company said in a press release Monday it heard from customers and employees that “access to comfortable seating and a clean, safe environment is critical to getting back to the Starbucks they know and love” resulting in the company scrapping its open-door policy.
Other tweaks include a ban on panhandling, discrimination, consuming outside alcohol and vaping, according to the policy posted online .
Employees have received training on the new rules.
Starbucks ( SBUX ) stock is up 7% over the past 12 months, but the company has posted three straight quarters of slumping sales and declining customer visits.
Global sales at stores open at least a year fell 7% last quarter and the number of customer transactions sinking by 8%. .
Investors will see how Niccol's turnaround plan is doing after the bell on Tuesday, when the company releases its next earnings report.

# Stock futures slide after Trump imposes tariffs | CNN Business.
CNN — .
US stock market futures plunged Sunday, one day after President Donald Trump announced 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico and 10% tariffs on China set to go into effect on Tuesday.
Dow futures were down 1.4%, or over 600 points, while S&P 500 futures dropped 1.9%.
The futures traded for tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite were down 2.4% as of 6:36 p.m. ET.
Bitcoin was also down 3.5% over the last 24 hours.
The sharp selloff in the futures market implies the indexes will also open substantially lower when trading kicks off Monday at 9:30 a.m. ET.
Hours after the Trump administration announced the tariffs, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said her country will impose retaliatory tariffs, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced “far-reaching” retaliatory levies.
China's commerce ministry said it will file a complaint with the World Trade Organization and “take corresponding countermeasures,” without elaborating.
“This will include immediate tariffs on $30 billion worth of goods as of Tuesday, followed by further tariffs on $125 billion of American products in 21 days' time, to allow Canadian companies and supply chains to seek to find alternatives,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Saturday.
More than 1,200 goods will be impacted by Canada's immediate tariffs, according to senior government officials on Sunday.
The imposed tariffs would be harmful for states such as Florida, which exports orange juice, fruits and vegetables to Canada, officials said.
Both the Mexican peso and the Canadian dollar weakened relative to the US dollar in the 24 hours since Trump announced the new tariffs, while the Chinese yuan hit a new low.
Economists warned that American families may bear the burden of these tariffs — and Trump posted to his Truth Social account that Americans could face “some pain.”
The tariffs will make groceries more expensive because Mexico and Canada are the main sources of America's imported agricultural goods .
Gas, steel and cars are among other goods expected to be more expensive for American consumers.

Title: With no evidence, Trump blamed DEI for a plane crash | CNN Business
# With no evidence, Trump blamed DEI for a plane crash | CNN Business.
New York CNN — .
President Donald Trump on Thursday blamed the Federal Aviation Administration's “diversity push” in part for the plane collision that killed 67 people in Washington, DC.
But DEI backers, including most top US companies, believe a push for diversity has been good for their businesses.
Trump did not cite any evidence for how efforts to hire more minorities, people with disabilities and other groups less represented in American workforces led to the crash, saying “it just could have been” and that he had “common sense.”
But Trump criticized the FAA's effort to recruit people with disabilities during Joe Biden's administration, even though the FAA's Aviation Safety Workforce Plan for the 2020-2029 period, issued under Trump's first administration, promoted and supported “the hiring of people with disabilities and targeted disabilities.” .
It's not the first time opponents of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, or DEI, have said they can kill people.
“DEI means people DIE,” Elon Musk said after the California wildfires , criticizing the Los Angeles Fire Department and city and state officials for their efforts to advance diversity in their workforces.
The Trump administration has clamped down on DEI in the federal government, ordering government DEI employees to be placed on leave, ending the use of DEI in hiring and federal contracting, and other measures to end DEI practices.
In the business world, DEI is typically a mix of recruiting practices, employee training and other measures to boost representation of people of different races, genders, classes, religions and other backgrounds.
Rather than lower hiring standards, supporters say DEI broadens the pool of people employers would consider for a job, in theory finding even more qualified people for tasks than they would have found in the past.
Companies that abandon efforts to promote diversity and inclusion risk missing out on the best talent, business leaders say.
“At its best, DEI is about developing talent, measuring it in a fair way and finding hidden talent and disadvantaged talent in a world where not everybody has an equal chance to exhibit their abilities,” Ken Frazier, the first Black chief executive of a major pharmaceutical company, told CNN in an October interview .
DEI initiatives have been shown to boost profits, reduce employee attrition and increase employee motivation, according to Boston Consulting Group research based on data from more than 27,000 employees in 16 countries.
Amid growing opposition from right-wing activists, lawsuits from conservative legal groups, demand from conservative-leaning customers and other factors, many high-profile companies have stepped back from some of their DEI pledges.
Walmart, McDonald's, Target, Harley-Davidson, Ford and many others have made changes to their DEI initiatives.
However, most companies remain committed to DEI.
The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that opposes DEI, found in November that 486 of the Fortune 500 companies still have a statement or corporate commitment to DEI on their websites.
Most of the changes companies like Walmart and Target have made are “cosmetic” and “inconsequential,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, the president of the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute.
Companies are adjusting language or repositioning programs rather than abandoning their commitments to expand diversity.
“Most of the leaders I speak to absolutely see the value [of diversity],” said Tarang Amin, the CEO of e.l.f.
Beauty, a cosmetics company that has stood behind its DEI programs.
“There's just so much data that says diverse teams perform better than homogeneous teams, that diverse thought really drives better outcomes.” .
Bigger companies are standing firmly behind DEI, too.
Costco recently rejected a proposal brought by a conservative think tank, the National Center for Public Policy Research, that would have required Costco to report on the financial risks of maintaining its diversity and inclusion goals.
The group criticized Costco for possible “illegal discrimination” against employees who are “white, Asian, male or straight.” .
Costco said its DEI efforts help the company attract and retain a wide range of employees and improve merchandise and services in stores.
Costco also said its members want to interact with a diverse employee base.
“Among other things, a diverse group of employees helps bring originality and creativity to our merchandise offerings, promoting the 'treasure hunt' that our customers value,” Costco said in its proxy statement to investors.
Efforts at diversity, equity and inclusion “enhance our capacity to attract and retain employees who will help our business succeed.” .

Title: How the Trump administration is building out its immigration enforcement machine | CNN Politics
# How the Trump administration is building out its immigration enforcement machine | CNN Politics.
Washington CNN — .
President Donald Trump has quickly mobilized wide swaths of the federal government to arrest and detain undocumented immigrants in the United States, part of a broader strategy to amass a large enforcement machine.
The administration has sent troops to the US-Mexico border, utilized military aircraft to repatriate recent border crossers, and deployed people from multiple federal agencies, including those under the Justice Department, to augment immigration enforcement operations.
Those shifts may cause tensions between agencies, as they compete for limited resources and manpower.
The administration is also drawing up plans to expand the government's holding capacity, turning to military bases and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
And private contractors are discussing options amongst themselves as they look to ramp up detention capacity.
“This gets them over one of the biggest hurdles they have which is resources,” said John Sandweg, former acting ICE director under the Obama administration, noting that getting additional funds from Congress will take time.
“By elevating this to a national security priority, tapping into DOD's abundant resources and DOJ with the federal agents, it's an immediate surge of resources,” he added.
The Trump administration is also expected to tap state and local law enforcement in the weeks to come to assist in their efforts to arrest undocumented immigrants.
Combined, the efforts mark a dramatic scaling up of the administration's enforcement apparatus and reflect Trump's aggressive immigration agenda.
White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller told CNN's Jake Tapper Tuesday that arrest quotas for Immigration and Customs Enforcement field offices of 75 per day should be treated as a “floor, not a ceiling.”.
“The goal is to arrest at least that many, but hopefully many more, and the Department of Justice is going to be closely involved in providing the manpower to help achieve those objectives,” Miller said.
'A force multiplier' .
US Customs and Border Protection has also been called upon to assist ICE, as the latter agency's field offices come under increasing pressure, according to multiple sources.
Interior enforcement is complex, often requiring careful planning, surveillance and operations that take place in the predawn hours.
Over the course of the past week, teams of ICE officers, along with agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, deployed nationwide to arrest undocumented immigrants who had been targeted as public safety and national security threats, according to Trump officials.
In an interview with CNN last week, White House border czar Tom Homan touted the joint effort, calling it a “gamechanger,” and describing the teams as a “force multiplier.”.
ICE has historically been underfunded and has a limited number of agents.
Trump officials were keenly aware of that as they prepared in the weeks leading up to Inauguration Day, drafting a spate of memos to delegate powers and trigger authorities, according to two sources familiar.
One of those included a Homeland Security memo requesting the help of state and local governments to enforce federal immigration law, citing a “mass influx” of migrants at the US-Mexico border.
That language was deliberate, according to one of the sources, describing the finding as a tool to trigger new state authorities for immigration enforcement.
The memo allows state and local law enforcement officers to carry out immigration enforcement, by invoking a sweeping legal authority that lets the Homeland Security secretary request aid under certain circumstances.
It's unclear how it would be implemented and whether it will require agreements and training.
Some former Homeland Security officials have raised concerns over pivoting law enforcement to immigration-focused missions and potentially leaving other work unattended.
“They clearly can do it.
But there's an opportunity cost.
What aren't they going to do?
” one former Homeland Security official said.
Enlisting the military.
One of the president's first acts, declaring a national emergency at the border, has already yielded action that was prominently showcased by the White House: the use of Pentagon assets on the US southern border.
The administration expanded its military flights carrying migrants to Ecuador last week, after a public feud with Colombia that almost resulted in a trade war.
And at the request of the Department of Homeland Security, Buckley Space Force Base in Colorado will be used to stage and process immigrants.
The facility is manned by ICE, among other agencies.
“This is only just the beginning,” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said in a post on X Monday.
Trump on Wednesday signed a memorandum directing the federal government to prepare the US Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to house migrants.
The process of expanding the holding facility is expected to last weeks and likely to fall short of Trump's stated goal of 30,000 people, given space constraints.
Guantanamo Bay hosts a separate migrant processing center previously used to temporarily house migrants apprehended at sea.
Under the Biden administration, Homeland Security officials considered using the center to temporarily hold more migrants in the event of mass maritime migration.
The process to expand capacity was expected to take around 30 days, depending on what assistance could be pulled in and how quickly, according to a former Homeland Security official.
Trump's top immigration advisers previously told CNN that management of a Guantanamo Bay detention facility for migrants would be overseen by ICE and reserved for what Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem described as “the worst of the worst.”.
Homan told CNN Wednesday that he wants the Defense Department to be “very involved” in immigration enforcement.
Pressed on how much more money he thinks Congress would need to allocate to fully carry out Trump's immigration plans, Homan said that they are “working on that number now.”.
“We need - the more money we have, the more successful we're going to be, right?
More money for beds, more money for operations,” he said.

Title: Clock ticking toward possible Costco strike Saturday | CNN Business
# Clock ticking toward possible Costco strike Saturday | CNN Business.
New York CNN — .
About 18,000 Teamsters are set to strike 56 Costco stores across six states early Saturday unless an 11th-hour agreement prevents what would be the largest retail strike in US history.
Talks resumed between the two sides Thursday, but there have been no updates on the negotiations.
In addition to disagreements on wages and benefits, the union said Costco had rejected proposals dealing with seniority pay, paid family leave, bereavement policies, sick time , and safeguards against surveillance.
Teamsters members at Costco make up 8% of the 219,000 employees at 616 US stores, according to company filings.
But a strike by that many workers would be significant for the largely nonunion sector.
Labor Department statistics show that less than 5% of retail workers are represented by unions.
Most of those unionized retail workers are in the grocery store sector.
The unionized store locations, which have not been identified by either the union or company, are in California, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Virginia and Washington.
Costco said on Friday that even if there is a strike and unionized workers don't report to work, “all of our locations will be open for business this weekend,” an indication that it intends to use management and nonunion staff to keep stores operating.
Meanwhile, while the Teamsters only represent workers at a small fraction of Costco stores overall, the union is prepared to set up picket lines at an undisclosed number of nonunion Costco stores nationwide, even if workers at those stores remain on the job.
Such a move could greatly increase the economic pressure on the company.
While there are only 18,000 Teamsters at Costco, the union has more than 1 million US members it can call on for those other picket lines.
Costco has a reputation for providing relatively good pay and benefits, especially compared to other retail chains.
Its annual company filing states that “our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits.
Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover, increasing productivity and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average.”.
In late 2023, when workers at a Costco store in Roanoke, Virginia, voted to join the Teamsters, the then-outgoing and incoming CEOs of Costco, Craig Jelinek and Ron Vachris, released a letter to employees.
“We're disappointed in the results in Norfolk,” the letter read.
“We're not disappointed in our employees; we're disappointed in ourselves as managers and leaders.
The fact that a majority of Norfolk employees felt that they wanted or needed a union constitutes a failure on our part.”.
“It was a pretty unique letter.
I've never seen management take that position,” Jane Jacobs, an attorney at Tarter Krinsky & Drogin, who typically represents employers in labor relations, told CNN.
The Teamsters have pointed to Costco's strong financial results as an argument for an improved wage and benefits package.
Costco reported record annual net income in the most recent fiscal year of $7.4 billion — up 17% from a year earlier and nearly double what it earned in 2019 ahead of the Covid-19 pandemic.
At a recent union rally held outside Costco's annual meeting, union members held banners reading: “Pro worker?
Prove it!
” and “Record profits = record contract.”.
“Costco has two choices: respect the workers who made them a success or face a national strike,” Teamsters President Sean O'Brien said in a statement earlier this month.
“If Costco thinks they can exploit our members while raking in billions, we'll shut them down.”.
Jacobs said that despite the differences at the bargaining table, there doesn't appear to be a large difference in total cost between their bargaining positions.
Costco confirmed a Reuters report that it recently sent a letter out to all employees at nonunion stores announcing it was raising pay by a dollar an hour to $30.20 this year and another dollar an hour each of the next two years.
Starting pay would be raised by 50 cents an hour to $20..
Jacobs said a good strategy for any employer is to give the nonunion employees the same pay and benefit package as unionized employees to remove the incentive to join the union.
But she said it's possible the Teamsters go on strike to press their current political advantage.
O'Brien has gotten closer to President Donald Trump than many labor leaders, Jacobs said.
He spoke at the Republican National Convention and did not endorse Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.
Meanwhile, Costco has refused to back off of its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts, which have become a focus of Trump's attacks in the early days of the new term.
Jacobs said she could see Trump publicly taking the side of the Teamsters if it goes on strike at Costco to put pressure on the company.
“This union is set up as well as any union to go on strike,” she said.
“One thing we know about this administration is they'll reward their friends and punish their enemies.”.
Michael Baker, retail analyst at DA Davidson, said that while a strike at only 8% of Costco stores probably isn't enough to prove a significant financial hit to the company's bottom line, a deal that is seen as a win for the union could spur organizing efforts at other stores across the chain.
Katherine Black, a partner in the food, drug and mass market retail segment at management consulting firm Kearney, told CNN that a strike would likely not last more than a week.
“It's very rare in this sector for a strike to lasts more than a few days,” she said.
“The longest I know of was one at Stop & Shop in 2019 that lasted 11 days.”.
Last year, the Teamsters staged a five-day strike at Amazon that ended the day after Christmas.
But unlike the situation at Costco, Amazon does not recognize the union as representing any of its workers and has refused to negotiate, let alone agree to terms on a contract.
Amazon doesn't even recognize that many of the strikers, who are drivers for third-party delivery services and have exclusive contracts with the online retailer, are its employees.

Title: What to do when the Fed starts cutting interest rates | CNN Business
# What to do when the Fed starts cutting interest rates | CNN Business.
New York CNN — .
Over the past couple of years, the Federal Reserve aggressively raised its key interest rate to a 23-year high to beat down inflation.
Now that inflation has slowed substantially and is expected to cool further, the central bank is expected to embark on a rate-cutting campaign over the next two years, starting as early as September.
If it does, rates should decline on a wide swath of financial products for Americans, from credit cards and home loans to bank accounts and certificates of deposit, among others.
Given how many ways lower rates can affect your finances, here are some things to consider when deciding what steps to take in response.
## Timing and magnitude matter .
The prospect of lower borrowing costs will be welcome news to those seeking loans or anyone trying to reduce their existing debt loads.
But, realistically, how much you'll save when the Fed lowers rates will depend on how quickly it cuts and by how much each time.
The answer for the near term is most likely to be “not that much.”.
“Interest rates took the elevator going up, but they will take the stairs coming down,” said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.
By that he means: “Rates are not going to fall fast enough to bail you out of a bad situation [this year],” McBride said.
“And for savers, [the initial declines] won't wipe out your interest earnings.
Savers will still be way ahead of the game.”.
That's because one or even two quarter-point rate cuts this year won't meaningfully reduce many of your interest costs.
But several cuts over the next year or two could make a noticeable difference, and it may be worth holding your fire on some moves until then.
“Don't jump the gun too early on this stuff,” said Chris Diodato, a fee-only certified financial planner and founder of WELLth Financial Planning.
Here's a breakdown of how lower rates may affect key areas of your financial life, along with tips from Diodato and McBride on what to do about it.
Getting a mortgage is one of the biggest financial moves most people ever make.
Mortgage rates are influenced by a number of economic factors, and the Fed's moves are one.
Since loan amounts are substantial, this is one area where even small cuts in interest rates could make a meaningful difference in what a homebuyer will pay.
For those buying a home this year, you may be tempted to buy down points to reduce your mortgage rate.
Before doing so, Diodato advised, crunch some numbers to make sure it will actually save you money if you think you may be tempted to refinance in a year or two should rates drop further.
That's because you will pay thousands of dollars to buy down your mortgage rate now, and then thousands more in fees to refinance.
To buy down a quarter of a point might cost you 1% of your loan or 4% for a full point, he said.
To refi, the costs could be higher — they typically run between 2% and 6% of your loan, according to Lending Tree.
Given that mortgage rates have fallen at least 1.25% in every rate-cutting cycle since 1971, and often over 2% or 3%, Diodato sees it this way: “Buying your rate down a quarter of a percentage point, or even a full percentage point, wouldn't stop most people from wanting to refinance at some point during the next rate-cut cycle.
So, my rationale is not to saddle folks with both paying for points and then the costs of a refinance.”.
As for taking out a home equity line of credit, be aware that it's no longer cheap money to borrow: The current average rate range for HELOCs is roughly 9% to 11%.
A couple of quarter-point rate cuts from the Fed won't make it meaningfully cheaper, McBride said.
“Americans are sitting on more equity than ever, but you have to be judicious about how you tap into it, given how much it costs to borrow against it.
Just because you have equity doesn't make it free money.”.
Of course, if you're just taking out a HELOC to serve as an emergency lifeline and you never tap it, the rate may be less of a concern.
But it still may cost you money by way of closing costs, any requirement that you withdraw a minimum amount at closing, or any other ancillary fees for having the line, such as an annual fee or inactivity fee, McBride noted.
And if you already owe money on a HELOC, he suggested, “aggressively pay it down.
It's high-cost debt that won't get cheaper soon.”.
Another perpetually high-cost form of debt is your unpaid credit card balance s .
A few rate cuts won't make much of a dent in today's record-high average rate of 20.7%.
Even if rate cuts ultimately push down the average to where it was at the start of 2022 — 16.3% — it will still be a pricey loan.
That's why, if you're carrying credit card debt, the advice is the same as it has always been: If you qualify, sign up for a zero-rate balance transfer card that can buy you at least 12 to 18 months interest free so you can meaningfully pay down the principal you owe.
If that proves difficult to get, see if you can transfer your balance to a credit card from a credit union or local bank that offers lower rates than the biggest banks.
“They typically have fewer perks, but their rates can be half as high,” Dodiato said.
If you want to finance the purchase of a new car, a rate-cutting environment may not help as much as you think.
McBride notes that every quarter point cut knocks $4 a month off a typical loan for a $35,000 car.
So a full percentage point drop amounts to just $16 a month, or less than $200 a year.
“Your real lever for savings is the price of the car you choose, how much you're financing and your credit rating,” he said.
As for leasing a car, McBride noted, the effect of a Fed rate cut may be equally small on the so-called “money factor” you will pay to lease, and because many variables determine what that factor will be, it will be hard to figure out the impact of lower interest rates.
The past year has been very good for anyone who parked cash in online high-yield savings accounts, many of which have been paying north of 5%.
The same goes for those who could lock up their cash for certain periods of time in certificates of deposits or Treasuries, many durations of which were also paying north of 5%..
While those rates will start to come down when the Fed starts cutting rates, the drops aren't likely to be huge at first — meaning you will still be able to earn more on your savings than the rate of inflation for a while, McBride predicts.
But it may no longer make sense to leave quite as much cash in these types of vehicles going forward.
“I caution people against the cash trap.
A lot of people, used to these nice savings rates, were diverting money from stocks and longer-term bonds,” said Diodato, who predicts yields on savings will eventually fall to 3% in the next two years.
His advice: Don't keep more than six months' to a year's worth of living expenses in cash or cash equivalents.
“Anything more than that and you're putting a drag on your future net worth,” he said.
That said, McBride suggested that if you're within five years of retirement, you might want to lock in some high rates still on offer today to grow the cash you'll want to cover living expenses in the first few years after you stop working.
Having that cash on hand means you won't be forced to pull from your longer-term portfolio should there be a big market downturn at the start of your retirement .
For instance, many CDs with durations of two, three, four or five years are currently paying between 4.85% and 5% on Schwab.com.
If you do opt for such a longer-term CD, try to find one that is not “callable.”
A callable CD is one that the issuer can decide to close out before its maturity date, which might happen if rates fall considerably during the next few years.
“The call feature is a 'Heads I win, tails you lose' for the issuing bank,” McBride said.

Title: Paris Men's Fashion Week: Fashion gets a political makeover | CNN
# Paris Men's Fashion Week: Fashion gets a political makeover | CNN.
Editor's Note: CNN Style is one of the official media partners of Paris Fashion Week .
See all coverage here .
Paris CNN — .
As Paris Men's Fashion Week kicked off — one day after the second inauguration of US President Donald Trump and amid the rising power of France's populist right — focusing on clothing might seem a touch frivolous.
Yet throughout the week, designers demonstrated their ability to engage with a larger societal landscape; by addressing concerns about inclusivity, protection and freedom, the Fall-Winter 2025 season provided a stage to escape as well as ideas to navigate the current climate.
From Willy Chavarria to EgonLab or Comme des Garçons Homme Plus, messages of unity and acceptance were sent down the runways.
When the “French population feels increasingly powerless in the face of the government, fashion's soft power, as an industry and an art, lies in its capacity to produce new discourses, images and impact other industries,” Carole Boinet, director of French cultural publication Les Inrockuptibles, told CNN . .
On the runways, workwear came back with a bang, reimagined and fused with contemporary wardrobes.
As bearded models in plaid shirts, raw denim and lumberjack-inspired lines walked the Junya Watanabe runway, the figure of the hipster seemed to hail back to 2010, when the aesthetic permeated youth subcultures and became a global phenomenon.
But it was “good old workwear originally crafted for forestry workers,” as outlined in the show notes, that was on the Japanese designer's mind.
With that, the collection reflected the season's running themes: the great outdoors and function in outerwear.
At Louis Vuitton, men's creative director Pharrell Williams teamed up with Nigo, the designer of LVMH fashion stablemate Kenzo and founder of Japanese fashion brand A Bathing Ape, to co-design a collection that merged workwear and sportswear.
Inspired by the practical wardrobes of engineers, chefs and gardeners, the clothing — including a double-breasted indigo blue denim jacket, a striped box-cut ensemble and a baby pink sleeveless blouson — were both elevated and practical.
Inspired by Maurice Sendak's 1963 children's book, “Where the Wild Things are,” Sacai founder and designer Chitose Abe, who has built a global business with her penchant for hybrid materials and oversized silhouettes, played with “ideas of living in nature, untamed and unrestricted by convention.”
She showed a collection of cocoon-shaped furry knitwear, some with exaggerated pockets, and also continued to create co-branded pieces with US workwear company Carhartt, which took the form of leather and puffer jackets in shades of dark brown and green.
Throughout the week, designers used their platforms to make overt political and social statements.
New York-based designer Willy Chavarria, a recent winner of the CFDA's Menswear Designer of the Year Award, brought his collection to Paris for the first time, to mark the tenth anniversary of his eponymous label.
Shown in the baroque setting of the American Cathedral, his sculpted, reworked tailoring once again took inspiration from his Mexican-American background; they came in a palette of gold, plum and burgundy.
As Chavarria explained to CNN, resilience and resistance was at the heart of his collection, as he sought to put forward a “message of human dignity and equality.”
He emphasized “the importance of us coming together to preserve our rights as citizens, as immigrants, as LGBTQ people, as women, all of us who are very much under attack right now.”.
Florentin Glémarec and Kevin Nompeix, the creative duo behind the Paris-based gender-fluid label EgonLab, incorporated playful Victorian nods as they presented garments that challenged traditional masculinity.
Backstage, the designers explained their focus on disenfranchised communities.
“ Minorities are systematically attacked by new politics around the world,” they said, adding that amid what felt like “a modern witch hunt,” they called for “minorities to unite and fight inequality.” .
At Comme des Garçons Homme Plus, war was on the mind of Japanese fashion designer Rei Kawakubo, whose collection, named “To Hell With War,” showcased deconstructed army staples, disheveled khaki uniforms and army boots.
Models wore reimagined helmets adorned with flowers, reminiscent of the flower power movement of the 1960s and '70s, when protesters focused on positive values, such as peace and love, in their fight for freedom.
Charles Jeffrey, founder and designer of London fashion label Charles Jeffrey Loverboy, drew inspiration from Berlin's Weimar Cabarets.
With exaggerated stage makeup, homoerotic banana-shaped accessories and a peel-like effect on garments, deconstructed kilts and disheveled knitwear, the designer — who opened the show in heels and spoke to spectators via a microphone — sought to echo the label's roots in nightlife.
For designer Jeffrey, it was “an opportunity to make people come together… when we have right-wing governments saying, 'you are only two genders'…we are a multitude of things,” he told CNN ahead of the show.
Some designers took a more introspective approach, focusing on the narratives embedded in clothing and tailoring details that might go amiss on camera.
Dior's collection referenced the H-line created by its founder Christian Dior for Fall-Winter 1954-1955 - a controversial silhouette at the time as its flattened shape appeared, for some, unfeminine.
In a cinematic setting, models descended with dramatic covered eyes, à la Stanley Kubrick's 1999 erotic psychological drama “Eyes Wide Shut.”
The collection also played with contrasting volumes from baggy male skirts to opera coats and dusted pink bows.
Bianca Saunders, the first Black British designer to win the prestigious ANDAM fashion prize, looked at the tension between constraint and movement, and suppleness and rigor, Shirts were creased, trousers' seams were twisted and their ankles were knotted. ..
Citing Robert Longo's photography, which captures men and women in exaggerated, contorted movements, she said that she took inspiration from “ how very structural menswear is pushed and pulled, all that subtlety of twisting things… capturing movement and slowness in the garment.” .
Craftsmanship and experimentation also took center stage at Rick Owens' show at the Palais de Tokyo.
True to form, Owens distorted and exaggerated body shapes while radically playing with techniques and textures — see the “dracucollar” jackets in wax-drummed leather, “megacrust” jeans, a crusted effect achieved by pressing bronze foil and wax onto denim, and even kemp fibers - an eco-friendly and subversive material also known as 'dead hair'.
As it often is with Owens, fashion knows no bounds.

Title: AiScout: Top soccer clubs are using a mobile app to find future stars | CNN Business
# AiScout: Top soccer clubs are using a mobile app to find future stars | CNN Business.
London CNN — .
A London-based technology company is looking to “democratize” talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app.
Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills.
It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them.
Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology.
The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch.
The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills.
“We're putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts'] time,” said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app.
“To say [to scouts], 'Go over to this place today because there's three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard' — that's going to be the best use of your time.'”.
It already appears to be working for some.
Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019.
After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club.
He signed a contract with EPL team Bournemouth in 2021.
Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app — which fully launched in September 2023 — according to Felton-Thomas.
Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year.
Felton-Thomas said the “lion's share” of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform.
Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for “tier one” sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid.
The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes.
The global market for sports analytics, valued at $2.7 billion in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research.
Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry?
For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods.
“It's more about evolution than revolution,” Felton-Thomas explained.
“We can't tell you when that player's actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity?
What happens when he's 2-0 down?
What happens when someone's shouting at him?
What happens when he's just made a massive mistake?”.
“We've got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you're still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.”.
While football remains ai.io's primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years.
Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports.
“You think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,” Felton-Thomas told CNN.

Title: Why DeepSeek could mark a turning point for Silicon Valley on AI | CNN Business
# Why DeepSeek could mark a turning point for Silicon Valley on AI | CNN Business.
New York CNN — .
Silicon Valley is coming to grips this week with the realization that creating an advanced artificial intelligence model may no longer be as specialized a task as was once believed.
The wakeup call came in the form of DeepSeek, a year-old Chinese start-up whose free, open-source AI model, R1, is more or less on par with advanced models from American tech giants — and it was built for a fraction of the cost, apparently with less advanced chips and it demands far less data center power to run. .
Until now, the widely accepted wisdom in the US tech world was that American tech giants could stay ahead by spending billions of dollars, amassing advanced chips and building out huge data centers (despite the environmental cost ).
Essentially, because they're among the richest companies in the world, they believed they could throw more resources at the problem than anyone else and come out on top.
Now, all of that has been called into question .
And tech giants are facing tough questions from Wall Street.
The name of the AI game may no longer be winning with the most expensive, ever-more powerful models.
“The paradigm is shifting,” said Zack Kass, an AI consultant and former OpenAI go-to-market lead.
“It's so hard to own a scientific breakthrough” such as an AI model advancement, Kass said, and prevent competitors from catching up.
Instead, tech companies may now find themselves competing to lower costs and build more helpful applications for consumers and corporate customers — and also to suck up less power and natural resources in the process. .
At least one American tech leader has already promised to respond to DeepSeek by speeding up the release of more powerful models.
OpenAI CEO Sam Altman called DeepSeek's R1 model “impressive” in an X post Monday, adding that “we will pull up some releases” of new models in response.
OpenAI Chief Product Officer Kevin Weil also said the company's upcoming o3 model, set to launch in the coming weeks, would “be another major step up.” .
“It's a super competitive industry, right?
And this is showing that it's competitive globally, not just within the US,” Weil said on a call with reporters about OpenAI's new ChatGPT offering for government agencies, in response to a question from CNN. “
We're committed to moving really quickly here.
We want to stay ahead.”.
But analysts also expect the Big Tech companies to scale back their data center spending plans and potentially rethink how much they're charging consumers.
DeepSeek has proved it's possible to provide the technology at a lesser cost, although some industry experts have raised eyebrows at the startup's claims about spending just under $6 million to build its model.
OpenAI's largest investor, Microsoft, is investigating whether DeepSeek trained its model off of stolen OpenAI data, Bloomberg reported .
Even if the company achieved its efficiency revolution with some malfeasance, DeepSeek's achievements have lit a fire under Silicon Valley's AI industry.
“All those other frontier model labs — OpenAI, Anthropic, Google — are going to build far more efficient models based on what they're learning from DeepSeek,” said Gil Luria, head of technology research at investment firm D.A. Davidson.
“And you'll be able to use those at a fraction of the price that you can now, because it's going to be a fraction of the cost to run those models.”.
To be sure, the industry was almost certainly going to eventually shift its focus to “efficiency” — working to add AI capabilities using a set amount of computing power versus adding more servers to juice the technology.
There are only so many computers you can build and only so much electricity available to service them.
And an AI tool can only get so proficient at, say, writing emails or planning trips, before making it marginally more powerful is no longer worthwhile.
But DeepSeek appears to have sped up that timeline.
And in Silicon Valley, unwinding spending on data centers could be tricky.
Just last week, OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank visited the White House to announce the creation of a new company and a $500 million investment in US AI infrastructure; Microsoft CEO Sundar Pichai affirmed he was “good for” his company's planned $80 billion investment in AI development and infrastructure this year; and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said his company's AI spending could reach as much as $65 billion this year.
“That crazy AI data center build-out that we've been talking about for the last couple of years?
They don't need to do that anymore.
They can build a lot less because they can provide a lot more services at a much lower price,” Luria said.
He added that investors will likely expect to hear about those plans in the American tech companies' earnings calls over the next two weeks.
Of course, if the tech giants cut data center costs for training AI models — and therefore charge customers less — their tools will get used more, putting more inference (or people asking questions) strain on the data centers, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts wrote Tuesday.
So just how dramatic that pullback on data center spending might be remains to be seen. .
Some tech leaders say they're looking at DeepSeek as validation — rather than a threat.
Proponents of open-source AI — where the model's underlying architecture is made publicly available, rather than charged for — say the Chinese model is proof that American companies should be sharing their innovations rather than gatekeeping them.
That way, the whole US field could advance more quickly and remain the technology standard around the world.
“The United States already has the best closed models in the world.
To remain competitive, we must also support the development of a vibrant open-source ecosystem,” former Google CEO Eric Schmidt wrote in a Washington Post op-ed Tuesday.
Meta, which has pushed open-source AI with its Llama model, also said such models are “driving a significant shift in the industry, and that's going to bring the benefits of AI to everyone faster.”.
And even if DeepSeek forces a short-term rethinking of the business model Silicon Valley had envisioned for AI, people who believe the technology will change the world should be glad for the advancement, Kass said.
“We are freaked out fairly, I suppose, because we thought we had global AI supremacy, when, in fact, we should be celebrating,” Kass said.
“Because this is one more piece of evidence that the AI revolution is going to democratize technology and it's going to be fairly distributed.”.

Save the Music, the nonprofit foundation that grew in popularity on cable TV in the late 1990s through the 2000s, is going indie.
Paramount Global is ending its financial support for the nearly 30-year-old program that promotes music education in public schools, the foundation announced Wednesday.
As a result, Save the Music is starting a $10 million endowment fund to sustain its mission as a fully independent nonprofit.
The change marks the end of an era for the organization, which was created in 1997 by a former VH1 executive and became a mainstay on the cable network's programming slate.
It spanned highly rated benefit concerts like “VH1 Divas Live” to TV ads fronted by A-list singers, including Celine Dion and Mariah Carey.
Paramount's decision to nix funding comes during a financially perilous time for the storied media conglomerate.
Last year, the company laid off 15% of its US staff and wrote down $6 billion in value of its cable television networks as part of its efforts to eliminate $500 million in annual costs.
It's also in the midst of an $8.4 billion merger with Skydance Media.
Given all of that, Paramount's decision to end its relationship with the foundation was for “obvious reasons,” Save the Music's Executive Director Harry Donahue told CNN.
The media company has made a final six-figure donation to its endowment, he said.
“Save the Music was founded nearly 30 years ago and since then, it has helped millions of students at more than 2,800 schools excel both academically and creatively through the enriching power of music,” a Paramount spokesperson said in a statement.
“We're honored to have been a part of this critical mission from the beginning, and we're excited to see Save the Music continue to thrive in this next chapter.”.
Donahue said the change has “been in the cards” since 2019 when Save the Music dropped VH1 from its name and reduced its reliance on a single source for money.
Currently, 95% of its budget comes from non-Paramount sources by garnering donations from major companies, including Amazon, TikTok and Meta; major record labels; and philanthropists such as MacKenzie Scott , who gave the foundation $2 million.
Nearly $4 million of the $10 million endowment is currently funded.
Also since 2019, it began to tweak its approach to funding and promoting music education, he said.
Under Paramount ( formerly Viacom ), Save the Music harnessed the popularity and viewership that VH1 used to have, noting that the “VH1 Divas Live” concert series was created to fund the program.
The foundation “would travel around the country with artists and celebrities dropping off instruments at schools and they would have, like what I would call the 'classic Oprah moment,' where you have a school assembly and there's a star there,” Donahue said.
“They pull a big sheet off a big pile of instruments on the stage and everybody goes crazy.
We really don't do that anymore.”.
Rather than focus on made-for-TV moments, Save the Music now embeds in communities and schools — some of which have been the victim of cutbacks within art and music programs — and creates investment plans to help fund instruments donations or music classes.
Of course, high-profile musicians will remain part of its mission with “artist ambassadors” making appearances at schools, including Ed Sheeran and Charlie Puth in recent years.
“The objective and the mission has always been the same, which is we think every student and every school should be making music as part of their education,” Donahue said.
“The way we do it now is very, very different.”.

New York CNN — .
It's one of the more obviously flawed ideas embraced by both President Donald Trump and his right-hand man Elon Musk: that government should be run like a business.
Synergies!
Streamlining!
Above all, efficiency — that is the operative word that will help transform the federal government from a hulking, bloated bureaucracy into a nimble machine, like swapping a 1995 Compaq desktop PC for a 2025 MacBook Pro.
Of course, Trump and Musk are applying a business playbook to a thing that is decidedly not a business.
Governments don't work for profit, and the services they provide aren't supposed to wow shareholders or go viral on TikTok.
Good government should fade into the background, unnoticed, so that Americans don't have to think twice about whether it's safe to get on a commercial flight or drink water from their tap.
That's not to say government agencies are perfectly calibrated.
But not all redundancies can be written off as needless red tape.
A leading commission on aviation safety, for one, was widely seen as an asset in bringing the sprawling US industry into alignment.
Trump disbanded it last week.
Less than two weeks in, and it's clear Trump is running the White House with the same dictatorial energy he brought to his companies — almost all of which have been privately held, with no outside board or public shareholders to cater to.
It's a style that also seems to suit Musk, who oversees half a dozen private companies and one public entity, Tesla (where he has stacked his board with loyalists and where he has regularly butted heads with shareholders)..
In the name of efficiency, the president and Musk are putting on a familiar show of cleaning house — a tactic so clearly modeled after Musk's past endeavors, they didn't even bother to change the subject line. .
On Day One, the head of the Federal Aviation Administration, who had publicly clashed with Musk over issues related to SpaceX, stepped down.
The post remained vacant for nine days.
It was only after 67 people were killed in a midair collision over the Potomac River in Washington that Trump announced the appointment of Chris Rocheleau, an FAA veteran who most recently ran an aviation business lobby, to lead the agency.
On his second day in office, Trump fired the heads of the Transportation Security Administration and Coast Guard, cutting both their terms short.
On Day Three, all members of a crucial aviation safety committee received a memo, per the AP , saying that the Department of Homeland Security was terminating the group as part of its “commitment to eliminating the misuse of resources and ensuring that DHS activities prioritize our national security.” (The advisory, by the way, was ordered by Congress more than 30 years ago in response to the Pan Am 103 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland, and brought together key groups in the aviation industry to advise the TSA on the most effective safety protocols.) .
Day Seven, trillions in federal funding were frozen indefinitely.
Day Eight, the US government did a carbon copy of Musk's Twitter playbook when it emailed 2 million federal workers with an offer to resign — once again sparking confusion and panic.
Among those 2 million workers were some 11,500 air-traffic controllers who have been stretched thin for years, often working overtime and battling burnout.
Last year, the FAA said it was still short 3,000 controllers , despite a surge in hiring.
Ten days in, and the sturdy bureaucracy — the folks tasked with keeping planes in the air, ensuring water is drinkable, providing housing to veterans, any number of other essential services — is in chaos.
And while the cause of the plane crash, just a few miles from the White House near Reagan National Airport, is not yet known, it is testing the new administration's response to a crisis at its own doorstep.
Unsurprisingly, Trump defaulted to a well-worn page of the playbook, heaping blame on his predecessors and suggesting that diversity initiatives eroded aviation standards — a statement that is just not true and, as usual, he offered no evidence.
Neither did Vice President JD Vance, or Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, or Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who all parroted the boss.
Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of federal workers are trying to do their jobs while weighing the offer to simply reply to an email with “resign” and walk away.
The offer purports to allow workers to leave with eight months of pay and benefits, though many questioned whether the offer was genuine or even legal.
That anguish appears to be part of the plan.
Russ Vought, Trump's acting head of the Office of Management and Budget, has stated plainly in private speeches revealed by ProPublica last year that “we want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected.” .
“When they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work because they are increasingly viewed as the villains.
We want their funding to be shut down…
We want to put them in trauma.”.

Title: Pentagon to swap traditional media with pro-Trump outlets under new rotational program for Defense Department workspace | CNN Business
# Pentagon to swap traditional media with pro-Trump outlets under new rotational program for Defense Department workspace | CNN Business.
CNN — .
One America News Network would soon replace NBC News and Breitbart would swap with National Public Radio in coveted Pentagon press corps workspace under a plan shared with journalists Friday night.
In what the Pentagon is calling a new “annual media rotation program,” The New York Post will also be invited to move into The New York Times' workspace.
And a fourth outlet affected by the rotation program, Politico, would be replaced by HuffPost.
Three of the changes, set to take effect on February 14, elevate relatively small and ardently pro-Trump media outlets while sidelining more popular, more mainstream news organizations.
The fourth is the exception: HuffPost, which has a progressive brand, is openly critical of President Donald Trump.
Curiously, though, the site does not currently have a Pentagon correspondent.
“If the Trump Administration and Secretary Hegseth are interested in more hard-hitting coverage of their stewardship of the Defense Department from HuffPost, we are ready to deliver,” a HuffPost spokesperson said Friday night.
NBC News said in a statement, “We're disappointed by the decision to deny us access to a broadcasting booth at the Pentagon that we've used for many decades.
Despite the significant obstacles this presents to our ability to gather and report news in the national public interest, we will continue to report with the same integrity and rigor NBC News always has.”.
CNN has reached out to representatives for The New York Times, NPR and Politico for comment.
The Friday night announcement is bound to provoke challenges from members of the Pentagon press corps.
But it is in line with the Trump administration's stated goals to challenge long-held norms and create space for new, opinionated online media outlets.
Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Ullyot said in the internal memo to the Pentagon Press Association that the changes apply to individual office spaces in the “Correspondents' Corridor” at the Defense Department — both a practical and symbolic move.
The year-by-year rotation program will “broaden access to the limited space of the Correspondents' Corridor to outlets that have not previously enjoyed the privilege and journalistic value of working from physical office space in the Pentagon,” Ullyot wrote.
Officials apparently chose one outlet “from each press medium” — print, online, radio and TV — to forfeit their existing space for one years' time.
The news outlets that are being replaced were effectively given two weeks' notice.
Members of the Pentagon press corps were left wondering why The Times, NBC, NPR and Politico were told to vacate the office space, and whether the decisions were related to their rigorous coverage of new Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, the former Fox News host who took charge at the Pentagon earlier this week.
“To be clear, the outlets that vacate the spaces loaned to them” by the defense secretary “will remain as full members of the Pentagon Press Corps,” Ullyot wrote.
“They will continue to enjoy the same media access to the Pentagon and will be able to attend and cover briefings and be considered for travel with civilian and military leaders in the Department as they have previously.
The only change will be giving up their physical workspaces in the building to allow new outlets to have their turn to become resident members of the Pentagon Press Corps.”.
Ullyot's memo billed the rotation system as a fair way to welcome more media outlets into US military headquarters, but the announcement came under immediate scrutiny.
Breitbart, for example, was selected as a radio outlet, replacing NPR this year.
But Breitbart - a well-known web site for pro-Trump coverage and commentary - barely has a radio operation of its own.
The word “radio” doesn't appear on its home page at all.
The media outlet has a distribution deal with SiriusXM and one big podcast, Breitbart News Daily.
Its footprint pales in comparison to NPR, which provides news coverage for local stations all across the country.
One America News was selected as TV outlet, replacing NBC this year.
While NBC produces some of the most-watched news programs in the country, like “NBC Nightly News” and “Today,” One America is so small that it eschewed the Nielsen ratings measurement service.
The far-right channel, headquartered in San Diego, faced multiple lawsuits stemming from the outlet's lies about the 2020 election.
Kevin Baron, a former vice president of the Pentagon Press Association, called the development “the erasure of journalism at the Pentagon.”.
“Kicking out reporters HURTS coverage.
If you can't file your stories from inside the building you are disadvantaged.
If you don't have a work space you are disadvantaged,” Baron said in a series of posts on X .
The National Press Club, an advocate for press freedom, said in a statement that it was troubled by the Pentagon's announcement and called on the Defense Department to provide greater clarity about the decision.
“The National Press Club is deeply concerned by the Defense Department's decision to remove certain media organizations from their dedicated spaces in the Pentagon,” National Press Club President Mike Balsamo said in a statement.
“Any action that restricts the ability of journalists to report on the operations of the U.S. government should alarm all who value transparency and press freedom.”.

Title: Microplastics are choking our waters.

# Microplastics are choking our waters.
Could a sponge made of squid bones help remove them?
| CNN.
CNN — .
Microplastics are everywhere.
They have been found on the peak of Mount Everest and in creatures inhabiting the deepest trenches of the sea .
They're in bottled water , human placentas and breast milk .
These tiny plastic particles choke wildlife, disrupt ecosystems, and threaten human health - and they are notoriously difficult to remove.
But scientists in China have come up with a possible solution: a biodegradable sponge made of squid bones and cotton.
A research team from Wuhan University used chitin from squid bones and cellulose from cotton - two organic compounds known for eliminating pollution from wastewater - to create a biodegradable sponge.
They then tested the sponge in four different water samples, taken from irrigation water, pond water, lake water and sea water, and found it removed up to 99.9% of microplastics, according to a study published last month in Science Advances. .
“The planet is under great threat from microplastics, and aquatic ecosystems are the first to suffer,” wrote the authors.
“Even under a variety of policies, including plastic product reduction, waste management, and environmental recycling, microplastic pollution is irreversible and escalating.”.
Microplastics are tiny shards of plastic smaller than 5 millimeters.
They come from everything from tires, which are then broken down into smaller pieces, to microbeads, a plastic found in beauty products such as exfoliants.
One study from 2020 estimated there are 14 million metric tons of microplastics sitting on the ocean floor. .
Scientists have called microplastics “one of this generation's key environmental challenges” and the problem is an internationally recognized environmental issue.
Plastic is a persistent pollution that hurts wildlife, the ocean itself and there's growing concern about the potential health risks it poses to humans.
The problem is only set to get worse with plastic production and pollution expected to increase in the coming years.
Even if we embarked on an immediate and globally coordinated effort to reduce plastic consumption, an estimated 710 million metric tons of plastic would still pollute the environment by 2040, according to another study.
That makes finding solutions to get rid of the plastics contaminating our oceans all the more urgent.
The sponge created by the Wuhan researchers was able to absorb microplastics both by physically intercepting them and through electromagnetic attraction, the study said.
Previously studied methods for absorbing plastics tend to be expensive and difficult to make, limiting their scalability.
Last year, researchers in Qingdao, China developed a synthetic sponge made of starch and gelatin designed to remove microplastics from water, though its efficacy varied depending on water conditions.
The low cost and wide availability of both cotton and squid bones mean the sponge created in Wuhan “has great potential to be used in the extraction of microplastic from complex water bodies,” according to the study.
Shima Ziajahromi, a lecturer at Australia's Griffith University who studies microplastics, called the squid-cotton-sponge method “promising” and said it could be an effective way to “clean up the high risk and vulnerable aquatic ecosystem.”.
However, the study's authors did not address whether the sponge can remove microplastics that sink to the sediment, which is the majority of microplastics in our waters, said Ziajahromi, who was not involved in the study.
Another “critical issue” is the proper disposal of the sponges, Ziajahromi said.
“Although the material is biodegradable, the microplastics it absorbs need to be disposed of properly,” she said.
“Without careful management, this process risks transferring microplastics from one ecosystem to another.”.
Ultimately, Ziajahromi added, minimizing plastic pollution is in the first place should remain a “top priority.”.

# From Venezuela to the US border: This family hoped for asylum in America.
Now they don't know where to go | CNN.
Ciudad Juarez, Mexico CNN — .
The main room in the El Buen Samaritano shelter in Ciudad Juarez, a city along the US-Mexico border, is quiet for most of the day.
Rows of bunk beds stretch from wall to wall, each separated by thin curtains or hanging sheets.
The mismatched mattresses are occupied by men, women, and children - all migrants who intended to reach the United States but haven't completed their journey.
It's the mid-morning of a cold Tuesday, most are resting or scrolling through their phones, the only noises in the room come from sporadic coughs, two children playing, and the subtle sounds from a video playing on a phone.
The scene feels like a loop.
At around 1 o'clock, Lucymar Polanco, a 32-year-old Venezuelan woman, checks her watch.
“Kids, guys, it's almost lunchtime,” she yells as she gets up and puts on a coat.
They're indoors but the walls are penetrated by the winter cold.
“Everyone up, let's get ready,” she says.
Her husband, her three kids, and five other relatives, all start getting ready enthusiastically.
Soon after, a shelter worker announces the food is ready to be served.
“I'm hungry, finally!” her 9-year-old son Abel Jesus, says.
Polanco and the other nine members of her family are among thousands of asylum-seekers who were stopped in their tracks by US President Donald Trump's January 20 decision to cancel all CBP One appointments for people seeking asylum from violence or persecution.
Their appointment had been set for January 21.
Now, they are stranded in the shelter in Juarez with no money and full of uncertainty.
From here, they can see across the border into the US - but they have no idea where to go now.
For the moment, the only thing they know is that it's time to eat.
After lining up, the family - whose members range in age from 5 to 40 - head to the shelter's dining hall.
They sit together and occupy most of a communal table.
As soon as they sit, they seem to put all their problems aside and focus on one another, on talking and enjoying the warm meal.
The day's menu: chicken soup and a small dish of rice and beans with canned tuna.
“The most delicious soup does exist,” 9-year-old Abel Jesus says with his mouth half-full and soup dripping from the edge of his mouth.
The adults chat and mostly talk about rumors they've heard about the CBP One app.
“I heard appointments until January 30 will be reinstated,” Luis Alfonso Polanco, 30, says of a rumor that later proved to be untrue.
“That's what a friend in the US told me.”.
On the other side of the table, his partner Yelitza Olivero talks to two other migrants from Ecuador and shares the rumor about the app with them.
At times, the family's border chatter turns into laughter and jokes about one another.
“We try to make jokes about each other, it's a way of distracting from the news we received on January 20, it was very sad,” Lucymar's cousin, 18-year-old Estiven Castillo, says.
“The point is to support one another, so one makes a joke, and we laugh, and we try to make a nice moment, otherwise, if we just focus on our situation, we'd all get depressed, so we laugh to keep from crying,” Lucymar tells CNN.
## Surviving the Darien gap and the cartels .
Lucymar and her family say they fled the Venezuelan state of Lara due to political persecution from authoritarian President Nicolas Maduro's government.
“We were part of an opposing political party,” she says.
“My family, my parents, everyone there, and the government knew that, and we'd constantly be threatened.”.
“I was set to receive a house from a program run by the government but after they found out who I voted for in prior elections, they took that benefit away from me,” she says holding back tears.
Prior to leaving Venezuela, both Lucymar and her brother, Luis Alfonso, worked in the beauty industry.
“I was a barber in Venezuela, but things were so bad that at times I cut hair in exchange for food,” Luis Alfonso says.
Lucymar's husband, Jesus Caruci, 40, worked as a mechanic, and Yelitza, who's married to Luis Alfonso, worked in sales.
The rest of the traveling family, all young adults or children, were in school before leaving the country.
Their journey began a little over two years ago.
They spent a few months in neighboring Colombia to later trek through several countries.
They crossed the treacherous Darien Gap safely - but were kidnapped by a cartel after arriving in southern Mexico.
“When we entered Tapachula, they were waiting for us,” Luis Alfonso recalls.
“They tricked us, they forced us into a vehicle and said they were taking us to a safe place (…) but they took us to a farm and held us there for six days.”.
Luis Alfonso says the criminal group only released after they paid $900 - all that they were carrying.
“Ever since we've survived with some money our family has sent us or that we've had to borrow,” he says.
## 'Trump, take our country and call it Venezuela of America' .
After sobremesa , the family goes to the shelter's patio to get some sun and continue to chat.
They gather several plastic chairs that are spread out through the uneven and cracked shelter pavement and form a circle.
The little kids decide to run around and play in an outdoor playset.
“I understand Trump,” says 19-year-old Beyker Sosa as the family stays quiet.
“There have been crimes done by illegal migrants, I understand the measures, they are meant to keep the country safe,” he adds.
“But we aren't criminals, I wish he (Trump) would have compassion, we are humans just like him.”.
CNN asked the family if they ever considered entering the US illegally and in chorus, they all said “no.”.
“We never considered entering illegally, we never want to hide from authorities, we wanted to be able to walk free,” Beyker says.
“It's very sad to have done things right, the legal way, only to have Trump shut the app down, but I guess God doesn't want us there.”.
The family says their smartphones and conversation are their only form of entertainment in the shelter.
“We can't even go out, we were warned that migrants are targeted in this area, so we just stay in, especially after already being kidnapped,” Lucymar says.
Still, with kids to entertain, snacks are a must.
Luis Alfonso and Estiven go to a store around the corner to buy cookies and soda.
As they return, they rejoin the conversation and start passing around Oreos and a plastic cup with orange soda.
“Trump should clean up Venezuela, we are good people, but he should up take out the bad ones, especially those in the government, take them out, Trump, and then take our country and call it Venezuela of America,” Beyker jokes as he refers to Trump's bid to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America.
Nearly two hours later, the family is back in the main room of the shelter with each settling into their beds again.
“This is all we do, we are either in our beds, on our phones, we wonder what could've been,” Lucymar says.

Title: Doomsday Clock 2025: Scientists set new time | CNN
# Doomsday Clock 2025: Scientists set new time | CNN.
Sign up for CNN's Life, But Greener newsletter.
Our limited newsletter series guides you on how to minimize your personal role in the climate crisis — and reduce your eco-anxiety . .
CNN — .
Seventy-eight years ago, scientists created a unique sort of timepiece — named the Doomsday Clock — as a symbolic attempt to gauge how close humanity is to destroying the world.
On Tuesday, the clock was set at 89 seconds to midnight — the closest the world has ever been to that marker, according to the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, which established the clock in 1947.
Midnight represents the moment at which people will have made the Earth uninhabitable.
For the two years prior, the Bulletin set the clock at 90 seconds to midnight mainly due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine , the potential of a nuclear arms race, the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza , and the climate crisis .
The clock isn't designed to definitively measure existential threats but rather to spark conversations about difficult scientific topics such as climate change, according to the Bulletin. .
“We set the clock closer to midnight because we do not see sufficient, positive progress on the global challenges we face, including nuclear risk, climate change, biological threats and advances in disruptive technologies” such as artificial intelligence , said Daniel Holz, the Bulletin's science and security board chair and professor in the department of physics, astronomy and astrophysics at the University of Chicago, in a news briefing Tuesday.
“The countries that possess nuclear weapons are increasing the size and role of their arsenals, investing hundreds of billions of dollars in weapons that can destroy civilization many times over.” .
Progress in the development of “disruptive technologies,” such as artificial intelligence, biotechnology and in space has also far outpaced regulation in those areas, Holz added.
“All of these dangers are greatly exacerbated by a potent threat multiplier — the spread of misinformation , disinformation and conspiracy theories that degrade the communication ecosystem and increasingly blur the line between truth and falsehood ,” Holz added.
The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists was founded by a group of scientists who worked on the Manhattan Project, the code name for the development of the atomic bomb during World War II.
Originally, the organization was conceived to measure nuclear threats, but in 2007 the Bulletin made the decision to include climate change in its calculations.
Over the last 78 years, the clock's time has changed according to how close scientists believe the human race is to total destruction.
Some years the time changes, and some years it doesn't..
The Doomsday Clock is set every year by experts on the Bulletin's Science and Security Board in consultation with its Board of Sponsors, which was first established by Albert Einstein in December 1948, with J. Robert Oppenheimer as its first chair.
The board currently includes nine Nobel laureates, many of them in physics, physiology or medicine.
The clock has been an effective wake-up call when it comes to reminding people about the cascading crises the planet is facing, but some have questioned its usefulness.
“It's an imperfect metaphor,” Michael E. Mann, Presidential Distinguished Professor in the earth and environmental science department at the University of Pennsylvania, told CNN in 2022, highlighting that the clock's framing combines various types of risk that have different characteristics and occur in different timescales.
Still, he added that it “remains an important rhetorical device that reminds us, year after year, of the tenuousness of our current existence on this planet.”.
Every model has constraints, Eryn MacDonald, an analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists' Global Security Program, told CNN in 2022, adding that the Bulletin has made thoughtful decisions each year on how to get people's attention about existential threats and the required action.
“While I wish we could go back to talking about minutes to midnight instead of seconds, unfortunately that no longer reflects reality,” MacDonald said.
The clock has never reached midnight, and Bulletin president and CEO Rachel Bronson said she hopes it never will.
“When the clock is at midnight, that means there's been some sort of nuclear exchange or catastrophic climate change that's wiped out humanity,” she said.
“We never really want to get there, and we won't know it when we do.”.
Though the clock can't measure threats, if it sparks conversation and encourages public engagement in scientific topics such as climate change and nuclear disarmament, then Bronson views it as a success.
When a new time is set on the clock, people listen, she said.
At the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland in 2021, then-UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson cited the Doomsday Clock when talking about the climate crisis the world is facing, Bronson noted.
Bronson said she hopes people will discuss whether they agree with the Bulletin's decision and have fruitful talks about what the driving forces of the change are.
Moving the clock back with bold, concrete actions is still possible.
In fact, the hand moved the farthest away from midnight — a whopping 17 minutes before the hour — in 1991, when then-President George H.W. Bush's administration signed the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with the Soviet Union. .
“We at the Bulletin believe that because humans created these threats, we can reduce them,” Bronson said.
“But doing so is not easy, nor has it ever been.
And it requires serious work and global engagement at all levels of society.”.
Don't underestimate the power of talking about these important issues with your peers, Bronson said.
“You might not feel it because you're not doing anything, but we know that public engagement moves (a) leader to do things,” she said.
Personal actions can make a difference.
To have a positive impact on climate change, look at your daily habits and see if there are small changes you can make in your life such as how often you walk versus drive and how your home is heated, Bronson said.
Eating seasonally and locally, reducing food waste , conserving water and recycling properly are other ways to help mitigate, or deal with the effects of, the climate crisis.

Title: Stargate: Trump announces a $500 billion AI infrastructure investment in the US | CNN Business
# Stargate: Trump announces a $500 billion AI infrastructure investment in the US | CNN Business.
New York CNN — .
Three top tech firms on Tuesday announced that they will create a new company, called Stargate, to grow artificial intelligence infrastructure in the United States.
OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son and Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison appeared at the White House Tuesday afternoon alongside President Donald Trump to announce the company, which Trump called the “largest AI infrastructure project in history.”.
The companies will invest $100 billion in the project to start, with plans to pour up to $500 billion into Stargate in the coming years.
The project is expected to create 100,000 US jobs, Trump said.
Stargate will build “the physical and virtual infrastructure to power the next generation of AI,” including data centers around the country, Trump said.
Ellison said the group's first, 1 million-square foot data project is already under construction in Texas.
AI leaders have for months been sounding the alarm that more data centers — as well as the chips and electricity and water resources to run them — are needed to power their artificial intelligence ambitions in the coming years.
“I think this will be the most important project of this era,” Altman said on Tuesday.
“We wouldn't be able to do this without you, Mr. President.”.
Oracle is among the biggest US data center operators.
And SoftBank has the kind of deep pockets needed to fund the expansion of AI infrastructure, which is expected to cost billions of dollars.
Altman has previously urged US officials to aid in that infrastructure buildout to ensure the United States remains ahead of China in the AI arms race, given that AI is poised to impact everything from the economy to military capabilities.
The OpenAI CEO also r eportedly met with Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son last year to solicit investment in new semiconductor plants for building AI chips.
Altman, who attended Trump's inauguration Monday, told Fox News last month that he believes Trump will “be very good at” attracting AI infrastructure investments to the United States and said he looks “forward to working with his administration on it.” .
“Infrastructure in the United States is super important, AI is a little bit different from other kinds of software in that it requires massive amounts of infrastructure, power, computer chips, data centers, and we need to build that here and we need to be able to have the best AI infrastructure in the world to be able to lead with the technology and the capabilities,” Altman said in the interview.
In a policy white paper published last week, OpenAI said investment in US AI infrastructure can ensure that US AI tools win out over Chinese technology, as well as creating new US jobs and economic opportunities, and urged the US government to create “foundational strategy to ensure that investment in infrastructure benefits the most people possible and maximizes access to AI.”
The brief estimated that there are “$175 billion sitting in global funds awaiting investment in AI projects.”.
“If the US doesnt attract those funds, they will flow to China-backed projects—strengthening the Chinese Communist Partys global influence,” the company said.
Oracle said in a statement that the Stargate project “will secure American leadership in AI, create hundreds of thousands of American jobs, and generate massive economic benefit for the entire world.
This project will not only support the re-industrialization of the United States but also provide a strategic capability to protect the national security of America and its allies.”.
SoftBank will have financial responsibility for Stargate and OpenAI will have operational responsibility.
A fourth partner, MGX, is also contributing funding.
SoftBank's Son will be Stargate's chairman, OpenAI said .
New presidents and presidents-elect have often held joint announcements with companies about massive US investments to promote a supposed rebirth of American industry.
But their track record for success is decidedly mixed.
Trump in 2017 announced with Foxconn a massive $10 billion electronics factory in Wisconsin that was expected to create 13,000 jobs.
But the company eventually abandoned most of its plans for the facility and the high-tech products it was set to build.
The company in 2021 said it would invest just $672 million in a revised deal that would create fewer than 1,500 jobs.
Foxconn has said it invested $1 billion into the state, however, and it still has a major manufacturing site for data servers with more than 1,000 employees.
But the facility Trump announced has become a Microsoft data hub that aims to train employees and manufacturers on how to best use artificial intelligence.
Trump on Monday also reversed an executive order passed by former President Joe Biden in 2023 that aimed to monitor and regulate AI risks.

# Barbie Hsu, Taiwanese actress known as 'Big S,' dies of flu-related illness at age 48 | CNN.
Hong Kong CNN — .
Taiwanese actor Barbie Hsu, one of the most prominent stars in the Chinese-speaking world, has died of a flu-related illness at age 48, Taiwan's official Central News Agency reported Monday, citing her sister.
Hsu died of pneumonia after catching the flu during a family holiday in Japan, her younger sister Dee Hsu said in a statement shared by her agent, CNA reported.
“I am grateful that I could be her sister in this life, to take care and accompany each other,” Dee Hsu said.
“I will always be grateful to her and miss her.”.
The star had faced poor health in recent years, her sister previously said on television.
Widely known as “Big S,” Hsu rose to fame at age 17 in the mid-1990s alongside her younger sister in Mandapop duo S.O.S. The siblings were known for their sharp sense of humor, underscored when both became popular talk show hosts.
But it was Hsu's lead role in the iconic 2001 television drama “Meteor Garden” that catapulted her to fame across the region as her portrayal of an ordinary girl who finds love with a rich boy resonated with millions of fans.
On Monday, “Big S passed away” became the top trending topic on China's Weibo social media platform, amassing over 1.5 billion views, as shocked fans mourned the star.
“This is really hard to believe,” a top comment with more than 54,000 likes said.
“It was so sudden, life is too short,” said another.
Many Chinese celebrities also expressed shock over Hsu's death.
“What a bolt from the blue,” her “Meteor Garden” co-star Ken Chu wrote on Weibo.
Hsu retired from the entertainment industry in 2022 following the end of her 11-year marriage to Chinese businessman Wang Xiaofei, a hot topic on social media on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.
She is survived by her husband, Korean rapper Koo Jun-yup, and two children from her previous marriage.

Title: Do you still need to pay for your home if it was destroyed by a disaster?
| CNN Business
# Do you still need to pay for your home if it was destroyed by a disaster?
| CNN Business.
CNN — .
Wildfires, raging floods, tornadoes and hurricanes can obliterate your home, but not your mortgage.
The hard reality is that even when you live in a federally declared disaster area — like those ravaged by wildfires in Los Angeles County or battered by hurricanes in North Carolina and other states — you still will owe the bank whatever is left on your loan, even though your house no longer exists or is uninhabitable.
There are, however, some disaster-related relief programs that can temporarily reduce or suspend your mortgage payment for up to a year and sometimes beyond, depending on your circumstance.
Here's what you need to know.
The servicer is listed on your mortgage statement and is the first place you should call to learn about your options, which typically involve a form of forbearance.
The types of mortgage relief a servicer can provide will be governed in part by the entity that backs your mortgage or holds it in its portfolio.
Usually that's an individual bank or a government agency (e.g., Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac, the Federal Housing Administration, the Veterans' Administration, etc.) If you're not sure which it is, your servicer can tell you.
Specific eligibility rules to qualify for forbearance may differ depending on which entity holds or backs your loan, but even if you were delinquent on your loan prior to the disaster, you still may be granted forbearance.
In the case of Fannie Mae, for instance, servicers are expected to offer relief to borrowers in cases of financial hardship, even if they'd been delinquent prior to the disaster, said Jenise Hight, vice president of the agency's single-family credit risk policy.
Typically, with a federally backed loan, you're likely to be offered forbearance of between three to 12 months, during which your mortgage payments will be suspended or reduced.
During the forbearance period, you should not be subject to late fees or legal proceedings like foreclosure.
(For those affected by the Los Angeles area wildfires, California Gov.
Gavin Newsom announced on January 18 that five big banks — Bank of America, Citi, JPMorgan Chase, US Bank and Wells Fargo — will automatically offer a 90-day moratorium on mortgages that will not preclude further relief.
They will also offer at least 60 days protection from new foreclosures or evictions.) .
If you don't call your servicer right away: Check the rules of the entity backing your loan, but Fannie Mae also expects servicers of the loans it backs to automatically offer forbearance for 90 days if they haven't heard from a borrower but know the person's home is in a presidentially declared major disaster area.
During that 90-day period, though, such borrowers should make it a top priority to call their servicer to explain their situation and work out a longer forbearance arrangement.
“It's very important that the borrower reaches out and stays in constant contact with the servicer,” Hight said.
You will still owe the money for the months your payments were suspended or reduced.
But you won't necessarily have to pay back those arrearages as a lump sum when your forbearance expires.
You may be able to work out a new arrangement with your servicer to spread out those back payments over a longer period of time.
“It all depends on a borrower's facts and circumstances,” Hight said.
For example, she explained, if you have a job and you can make your regular mortgage payments but just need more time to pay off the arrearages, you may be able to work out a new deferral plan or spread out the amount you owe from the forbearance period over a certain number of months on top of your regular payments.
Or, if you're still struggling financially and can't even manage to make your normal payments after forbearance, you might work out a loan modification with the servicer, which would potentially lower your monthly payments going forward, extend the term of the loan and spread out the arrearages owed over the new life of the loan.
Rules governing mortgage relief for loans backed by Freddie Mac are similar.
And that agency notes that even if your home survives after a disaster but your job doesn't, you may still be able to get forbearance.
When your physical and financial life get turned upside down by an external disaster, it can be hard to think straight.
So if you need help dealing with your mortgage and other disaster-related financial issues, you can find free, experienced assistance.
Individual lenders and mortgage backers may offer you the services of free housing counselors.
And the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and other disaster relief organizations may direct you to trusted partners in the arena.
One such group is Operation HOPE , which works out of the recovery centers set up by FEMA and the American Red Cross .
It also offers services online and via mobile app.
The person assisting you can act as an approved third-party representative to negotiate a mortgage forbearance arrangement with your servicer and help you fill out any necessary applications and get copies of destroyed documents.
In previous disasters where the group has worked, including Hurricane Helene and the Maui fires, Operation HOPE has found that lenders usually render a decision within 48 to 72 hours on forbearance, said Lance Triggs, president of program operations for the organization.
That timeline squares with a statement sent to CNN from Chase Home Lending, for instance: “Once a customer requests disaster forbearance, requests are reviewed within 2 business days and the protections are set up immediately.”.
Operation HOPE can also help you negotiate with other creditors and assist you with the complexities of securing insurance money.
“Historically, we find that at least 40% of people [we've worked with after a disaster are] underinsured or not insured,” Triggs said.
If your homeowners' insurance policy was dropped or lapsed just before the disaster, Operation HOPE may get on the phone with your old insurer to see if they can reinstate it retroactively or connect you with other resources to try help fill the gap.

Title: Federal employees confused, angered by Trump's offer to quit | CNN Politics
# Federal employees confused, angered by Trump's offer to quit | CNN Politics.
CNN — .
President Donald Trump's offer to most federal employees to resign now and be paid through September stunned the workers who received it - angering some, confusing many and raising questions about whether the offer is even legal.
When a US Department of Agriculture staffer based in Mississippi received the deferred resignation offer on Tuesday, they read through it, laughing because it was just “nonsensical,” and then deleted it.
“I've got my whole entire life invested in the federal government,” said the staffer, who also spent time in the military.
“I'm not going to throw everything away.”.
Across the United States, multiple federal workers who spoke with CNN said they weren't willing to sacrifice benefits beyond their salaries - including health and retirement benefits and student loan forgiveness - not to mention careers.
They requested their names not be used for fear of retaliation.
Federal workers' unions quickly lashed out at the deferred resignation offer, stressing that it was not a buyout and that the administration might not be able to follow through on it.
“Employees should not take the Program at face value,” the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal workforce union, told members about the offer in an FAQ on Wednesday.
The communications from the Office of Personnel Management are “riddled with inconsistencies and uncertainties.
It is also unclear whether OPM has the legal authority to support the Program or its alleged benefits, and the eligibility criteria are vague.” .
The union warned that the offer contains no guarantees that employees whose resignations are accepted “will receive the benefits that the Program purports to offer.”
And it noted that the federal government is only funded through mid-March, so the Trump administration cannot make payment promises beyond then until Congress passes a spending bill.
The backlash prompted the Trump administration to send another email to employees on Friday, this time coming from their individual agencies.
It reinforced, in underlined text, that the offer is “valid, lawful, and will be honored by” the respective departments.
Also, those who accept the offer will “not be subject to a reduction-in-force or other premature separation,” will not be expected to work during the roughly eight-month period (with rare exceptions) and can take a non-governmental job during that time.
Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller said, without evidence, that “a significant number of federal workers have accepted the buyout offer” during a gaggle with reporters at the White House Friday.
But workers CNN interviewed are not jumping at the chance to jump ship.
The Mississippi USDA employee, who said accepting the offer is out of the question, was most offended that the OPM email referenced that federal employees should be “loyal.”.
“When I raised my right hand way back a long time ago, I swore to defend the Constitution,” they told CNN.
“So I'm not loyal to anybody.
I'm loyal to my country.”.
The OPM email, which contained the subject line “Fork in the Road,” had many similarities to an email that X, then called Twitter, sent to its employees days after Elon Musk took over the company.
Musk now leads Trump's Department of Government Efficiency , which has been tasked with shrinking the federal workforce as one of its mandates.
The offer came as Trump seeks to reshape the federal workforce - including reducing its size, replacing career workers with political appointees, wiping away some civil service protections , ending diversity efforts and more.
Some 2.4 million people work for the federal government, not including postal workers, who are not eligible for the package.
Also excluded are military personnel and those in positions related to immigration enforcement and national security, among others.
Those who qualify have to decide by February 6.
A US Department of Agriculture employee, who is nearing retirement, said they won't take Trump up on the incentive and don't expect anyone else in their field office in Illinois to, either.
“They're trying to change everything overnight,” said the employee.
“They're trying to reinvent the government, and I don't think they can do it.”.
“I retire by 60.
I have my 25 years.
I'm vested.
I'm not going anywhere,” they continued.
Trump's administration is also seeking to crack down on federal employees working from home or in hybrid roles , rather than in their offices full-time.
But much of the federal workforce is located outside the nation's capital, and Trump's offer was met with confusion and skepticism in many of those offices.
While some workers said it was unclear from the original email if they'd have to continue working through September, an FAQ on the OPM site said that employees would not be expected to work and were encouraged to find private sector jobs.
“You are most welcome (to) stay at home and relax or to travel to your dream destination.
Whatever you would like,” the FAQ read.
Others didn't like the ominous warning in the OPM email that if they opt to stay, “we cannot give you full assurance regarding the certainty of your position or agency.”
They also bristled at the OPM FAQ that encourages workers to move from “lower productivity jobs in the public sector to higher productivity jobs in the private sector” to boost American prosperity.
A Labor Department employee told CNN they initially considered the offer, but said, “as time passes, more skepticism grows,” in part because of their doubts that the Trump administration will follow through on the eight months of pay it offered.
One Department of Veterans Affairs worker said the Trump administration's offer had backfired.
“Before today, I heard nothing except folks wanting to leave,” the worker said a day after receiving the offer.
“Today folks are determined to stay.”.
The initial offer to quit raised eyebrows among some who said the emails they've received lately from the OPM did not look legitimate.
Some thought the initial test emails OPM sent last week were phishing scams, prompting them to ask their managers what to do.
Some federal workers said Trump's changes will uproot their lives - and said the offer diminishes the value of work they believe helps Americans.
One Internal Revenue Service worker told CNN that the offer angered them, although a few of their colleagues have expressed interest in it.
“Do they think we're stupid enough to do it?” said the staffer, who intends to stay with the federal government until retirement, which is still years away.
“They are going to have to fire me.”.
The worker, who lives in the South with their spouse and young child, said they find it fulfilling to help people.
“I really do love it, especially when I'm on the phone with someone getting their problems sorted out and [the taxpayer is] having money coming their way that they've been desperately trying to get ahold of on their own,” the IRS staffer said.
Some workers found the OPM email disturbing.
One Department of Interior employee - who said their division is already understaffed and has had to hire contractors, who are paid more - couldn't sleep on Tuesday night after receiving the deferred resignation package.
“It's intimidation.
It's harassment,” said the worker, who lives in Oklahoma. “
It's questioning all the hard work and importance of what we do.
Being treated like this is not humane, and it's not professional.”.
The OPM email was written in a manner designed to coerce federal employees to resign, Doreen Greenwald, national president of the National Treasury Employees Union, told CNN in an interview.
“It was written in a very negative tone, in a threatening manner,” she said.
“It provided no clarity on what was being offered.”.
After OPM announced the offer, the union sent an urgent notice to members “strongly” urging them not to resign.
The NTEU wanted to reassure employees that they had a choice, Greenwald said.
“There were no answers provided in that document, and so we had to provide that information to our members to protect them,” she told CNN.
Plus, having a mass exodus of federal employees “would be catastrophic to the federal government and the services that Americans depend on every day,” Greenwald said.
Other federal employee unions had similar messages for their members, all questioning the legality of the offer.
“Unlike structured programs that the federal government offered in the past to decrease the number of federal employees, this maneuver is intended to panic civil servants into accepting what seems like a sweet deal but is probably a scam,” Randy Erwin, national president of the National Federation of Federal Employees, said in a statement Wednesday.
“The offer is a scare tactic designed to pressure federal workers into quitting while promising under an illegal and unenforceable agreement to pay them until October.”.

CNN — .
This Super Bowl Sunday, keep an eye out for bad calls, fouls and dangerous sodium levels.
Foods advertised in National Football League commercials contain an average of nearly 40% of the daily recommended sodium intake, according to a new study.
“We proved what probably a lot of people have long suspected, and that is that foods advertised during NFL games … are frequently high in sodium and calories and fat content,” said senior study author Dr. Paul Hauptman, dean of the University of Nevada, Reno's School of Medicine and chief academic officer for Renown Health.
Researchers recorded 10 NFL games between September 2023 and November 2023 and analyzed the number and duration of commercials advertising food products.
The team then looked at the nutritional information of those foods.
About 10% of the content, or 102 commercials, were advertising food, according to the study published Thursday in the journal JAMA Network Open .
The sodium content of those foods ranged from 220 milligrams to 1,872 milligrams, with a median amount of 910 milligrams, the study showed.
The Dietary Guidelines for Americans﻿ recommends people consume less than 2,300 milligrams per day. .
Fast-food restaurants advertised the products with the highest amount of sodium, the researchers found.
Eating too much salt can have many negative effects on your health.
High levels of sodium in a diet can lead to worsening of heart failure and hypertension, or high blood pressure, Hauptman said.
“Blood pressure is directly related to stroke, cardiovascular disease -- even to death from cardiovascular disease and heart failure,” said hypertension specialist Dr. Stephen Juraschek, an associate professor of medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School in Boston.
He was not involved in the research.
“Hypertension affects nearly half the US population, 1.5 billion adults worldwide , and is growing,” he added.
“This is a tremendous problem.” .
Salt isn't the only problematic ingredient in a lot of the foods advertised on television.
The fat and calorie contents are often high as well, which can have an especially negative impact on people with diabetes, Hauptman said.
Many aspects of watching a football game can impact the way you eat.
It's a sedentary activity, people often serve special foods to share, and the commercials make unhealthy foods look exciting to eat, Juraschek said.
“Advertising in general is intended to encourage certain types of behaviors, and when you look at products when they're being advertised, they're usually showing people smiling in kind of memorable, exciting occasions, maybe with loved ones or friends,” he added.
Many of the elements that go into how you make your food choices are emotional, Juraschek said.
Maybe you celebrate certain occasions with a particular food, or a certain dish is associated with spending time with people you love.
Advertisements may be trying to send you the message that partaking in the food they are trying to sell you will contribute to feeling close to your loved ones or having a good time, he added.
“And if those items are high in sodium and are highly processed … folks will be directed towards consuming more of those products, which is really concerning,” Juraschek said.
Because food choices are so often tied to traditions and memories and it can be so hard to adjust, Juraschek recommends being careful about what you are feeding children.
“It's so important early on that we don't overexpose young children to high sodium,” Juraschek said.
“Getting them hooked at a young age can contribute to a lifetime of chronic disease and disability.”.
Eating a healthy diet isn't always easy.
One essential step is to recognize where the sodium in your diet is coming from, Juraschek said.
Many patients say they don't add salt in their cooking, but it's also important to look at the processed foods you eat -- such as breads and deli meats -- which can have a surprising amount of sodium.
“Whenever you get away from the produce and kind of the fresh meat sections of the store and get to the middle, you'd be like, 'Wow, there's so many different products here, but almost every single one, universally, has a large amount of sodium,'” Juraschek added.
Going to a restaurant also can result in higher sodium consumption than home-cooked food, he said.
Next, try to make simple switches to lower-sodium options, Juraschek said.
Not all chips, dressings or dips have the same sodium content.
“We grow up with certain traditions, exposures -- we have memories around those food items,” he added.
“That's one way that we can still kind of enjoy that product, but maybe with less exposure.”.
And you might find that, over time, you don't miss the salt so much.
“Patients who are able to adhere to a low-sodium diet, not only are their symptoms better if they have heart failure, but their palate sort of adjusts,” Hauptman said.
Then, when patients are given foods high in sodium, they can taste it -- and they don't often like it, he added.
“Eat in moderation, and just try to read labels,” Hauptman said.

Title: Trump's race to honor his promises is bringing risk and turmoil to America and the world | CNN Politics
# Trump's race to honor his promises is bringing risk and turmoil to America and the world | CNN Politics.
CNN — .
President Donald Trump is doing exactly what he said he'd do.
He's launching hard-power trade wars to please voters marginalized by the globalized economy.
He's acting on despair over fentanyl's murderous toll.
He's launched a migrant crackdown amid anxiety over a porous southern border.
And the president, with the help of Elon Musk , is starting to gut the government that his supporters blame for their problems.
“When a president is elected by the People and then does what he promised to do, that's democracy,” Vice President JD Vance wrote on X on Saturday night.
“When a president is thwarted by unelected bureaucrats, that's oligarchy.
President Trump refuses to bend the knee to that oligarchy.
Buckle up!”.
Yet Trump's frantic push to honor campaign promises by a plurality of voters may come with a price.
Abroad, it threatens to compromise traditional American leadership and obligations the country has long set for itself, which are vital to the functioning of the global economy.
International agreements and undertakings made to allies are also in peril — like the North American trade deal Trump trampled with huge new tariffs on Canada and Mexico and the treaty under which the US handed over control of the Panama Canal .
And at home, a quickening purge of federal government workers and erratic spending decisions have already called into question assistance that's critical to the well-being of millions of citizens, as well as the legality of ousting scores of federal workers to fulfill Trump's political whims.
As Trump's second presidency enters its third week, there are growing questions over whether his radical disruption — which often flouts generations of US policy and even challenges the law — will fix any of the problems he was elected to solve.
Could it instead cleave deeper national divides, create economic chaos and pain for consumers — who elected him, in part, to lower prices — spike job losses, and leave America isolated after alienating its best friends in the world and destroying the international order?.
Trump won't hear of such talk.
You can argue with his grasp of economics.
But he's promising a complete overhaul of the global, free trade economy and a rebuilding of the US manufacturing base — even if it throws American allies into economic crises.
The days of a rising tide lifting all boats are over.
“MAKE YOUR PRODUCT IN THE USA AND THERE ARE NO TARIFFS!” the president wrote on Truth Social on Sunday.
“Why should the United States lose TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN SUBSIDIZING OTHER COUNTRIES.”.
Trump announced 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico and 10% levies on Chinese imports that are due to come into force at 12:01 a.m. ET on Tuesday.
The president said Sunday evening that he plans to speak to leaders in Canada and Mexico on Monday, though gave no sign he'd change his mind.
“I don't expect anything very dramatic.
We put tariffs on.
They owe us a lot of money, and I'm sure they're going to pay,” Trump told reporters as he stepped off Air Force One.
His faith in tariffs — a familiar device that helped speed the descent into the 1930s Great Depression — represents a huge gamble.
“This is a self-inflicted wound to the American economy,” former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said on CNN's “Inside Politics Sunday.”
Summers, who served under Democratic President Bill Clinton, added: “I'd expect inflation over the next three or four months to be higher as a consequence, because the price level has to go up when you put a levy on goods that people are buying.”.
Dismantling government can also be dangerous.
A temporary spending freeze, hurriedly withdrawn by the White House last week , hinted at mayhem that could ensue if federal services on which millions depend go away.
Trump's biggest moves so far reflect some of his lifelong obsessions, including a tendency to exert power over weaker adversaries.
His supporters insist it works — citing Colombia's retreat last week, in a showdown over migrant deportations, under the threat of economy-destroying US tariffs.
They also credit Trump's warning that “all hell will break lose” in the Middle East for recent the hostage releases by Hamas in Gaza.
But Trump's extraordinary steps to transform US domestic and foreign policy at lightning pace also pose political and economic risks.
His wielding of vast executive power could come across as an overreach that ignores voters' most pressing concerns.
And he risks driving US allies into the arms of adversaries like China.
It all amounts to a stunning blitz of economic, diplomatic and domestic power, happening by design at a fearsome pace, often without public transparency, that is almost impossible for citizens to process.
## Trump's power moves are shaking North America and the rest of the world .
* The president this weekend announced 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico and imposed 10% tariffs on Chinese exports to the United States.
He's also renewing his demand that Canada become the 51st state.
Trump has been coercing Denmark to hand over Greenland and Panama to give up control over its canal.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned Panama's president Sunday that Washington would take “measures necessary to protect its rights” under the Panama Canal Treaty because Hong Kong-based firms own two ports near either end of the key waterway.
Trump later warned: “We're going to take it back, or something very powerful is going to happen.” .
* Trump has also frozen US foreign aid , which has been maintained for decades on the principle that fighting starvation, poverty and illness fosters global stability that makes Americans safer.
Nongovernmental organizations are struggling to work out which services qualify for a State Department humanitarian waiver .
The US Agency for International Development's website just went dark .
And Musk declared over the weekend on X that the agency responsible for saving millions of lives is “a criminal organization.”
He added: “Time for it to die.” CNN reported on Sunday that top security officials at USAID were put on administrative leave after attempting to refuse access to agency systems to Musk's Department of Government Efficiency officials.
* At home, as it cranks up the pace of mass deportations, the administration Sunday revoked protection for 300,000 Venezuelans, leaving them vulnerable to being deported to their repressive, impoverished homeland.
* Trump's teams have accelerated a purge among law enforcement officials, firing more than a dozen prosecutors who worked on January 6, 2021, cases and demanding names of FBI agents ordered to work on Trump cases — a move that could potentially put the careers and livelihoods of thousands in peril.
* Musk, the tech pioneer who has billions of dollars in contracts and potential conflicts of interest with the US government,
stoked more disruption.
His DOGE team has accessed the federal payments system, potentially allowing him to monitor and limit government spending, after the top civil servant at the Treasury Department — who had pushed back on questions about stopping certain payments — left unexpectedly last week .
Trump's new trade wars encapsulate his unrestrained use of power and show how his beliefs contradict decades of conventional US global leadership.
The massive tariffs he plans to impose on Canada and Mexico on Tuesday can be traced back to his long-held belief that America is being ripped off by almost every other nation.
The tariffs' ostensible purpose is to punish American allies for failing to do more to crack down on undocumented migration and fentanyl reaching the United States.
Many Trump supporters see the president's love for “beautiful” tariffs as leverage to force concessions from other countries and to allow him to deliver “wins,” which often seem less meaty than he claims.
But this time, the imposition of tariffs is being billed as a victory in itself.
“These are promises made and promises kept by the president,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Friday.
But the win will come at a cost.
Canada said Saturday it would impose retaliatory tariffs on more than $100 billion in American imports.
Several top provincial politicians, meanwhile, urged Canadians to start boycotts of US products, including wine and liquor.
Mexico is vowing to unveil its own response Monday.
President Claudia Sheinbaum warned Sunday that talks, and not confrontation, are the best ways to solve problems.
She said: “Sovereignty is not negotiable.”.
While tensions have long boiled between the US and Mexico over border issues, problems at the northern border seem negligible.
According to US Customs and Border Protection statistics, only 43 pounds of fentanyl were seized at the northern border last year, compared with more than 21,000 pounds captured at the southwest border.
And Canada has already pledged to spend $1 billion on an enhanced border patrol operation.
This begs the question of whether America's No. 1 foreign priority is really addressing a threat from Canada, with which the US enjoys its most comprehensive trading partnership.
Trump's turn against Canada — which effectively trashes the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement that he signed in his first term and declared a great victory — risks pitching the economy of a trusted ally into a deep recession and costing hundreds of thousands of Canadian workers.
And while Mexico and Canada are in a vulnerable position because of their smaller economies, they can still hurt the US.
Their retaliatory tariffs could raise prices on key goods — even as Trump vows to lower grocery costs for US shoppers.
Trump's tariff attacks on Mexico and Canada also reverse a decadeslong project to integrate the US and Canadian economies — part of a broader US foreign policy goal of building a rules-based global order of free nations meant to promote prosperity and democracy.
In Canada's case, this has meant coming to America's defense, in its greatest hours of need — including after the September 11 attacks in 2001.
“History has made us friends, economics has made us partners and necessity has made us allies,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Saturday.
“That rang true for many decades … from the beaches of Normandy to the mountains of the Korean Peninsula, from the fields of Flanders to the streets of Kandahar.”.
Trump, however, seeks far greater control over the Western Hemisphere — which, together with his love of tariffs, is creating a 19th century vibe.
“Canada should become our Cherished 51st State.
Much lower taxes, and far better military protection for the people of Canada — AND NO TARIFFS!
” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Sunday from Florida, where he twice visited one of his golf courses over the weekend.
But the president's threats are backfiring.
“It's an act of economic warfare.
And the president was clear just this morning that it is a direct attack on our sovereignty,” former Canadian Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland told CNN's Fareed Zakaria on Sunday.
Freeland, a candidate for the leadership of Canada's Liberal Party, and therefore to replace Trudeau as prime minister , added: “Americans are going to be astonished by the Canadian response.
We're hurt, for sure, because we're your friends and neighbors.
But most of all, we're angry, and we are united and resolute.” .
Still, Trump isn't hiding what he wants, and right now, he is wielding almost unaccountable power.
“We are led by someone who is not very mysterious.
He's going to tell you what he's going to do and he'll actually do it,” Rubio said on Sirius XM's “The Megyn Kelly Show” last week.
Or, as Vance put it: “Buckle up.”.

CNN — .
By the time he died, aged just 32, he had redrawn the map of the northern hemisphere, conquering land across three continents and ruling over states from Egypt to modern-day India — over 2,000 years ago.
Since his death in 323 BCE, the world has been obsessed with Alexander the Great, who set out from his kingdom of Macedon (in modern-day Greece) at the age of 20 to conquer the mighty Persian Empire.
He made it as far as the Indus River in modern-day Pakistan, and even crossed into today's India, before dying in Babylon in today's Iraq.
Over 2,000 years later, travelers can still see his legacy in countries as far afield as Egypt, Turkey and Pakistan — as well as Greece, of course, where, in 2024, archaeologists opened the Royal Palace of Aigai to visitors.
The palace was the ceremonial hub for the Macedonian dynasty, and Alexander was crowned here following the assassination of his father, Philip II.
There are dozens more sites around the globe where visitors can get close to the man — and the myth.
What Alexander achieved in his 32 years is “unique,” says Paul Cartledge, AG Leventis professor emeritus of Greek culture at the University of Cambridge, who adds that the Macedonian “redrew the map of the world” by force, where his father had always tried diplomacy first.
Crowned king of Macedon in 336 BCE at the age of 20, Alexander spent just two years in Europe after Philip's assassination, shoring up his rule and putting down revolts in southern Greece and the Balkans.
Then, in 334 BCE, he led his army into Asia to fulfil Philip's ambition of conquering the Persian Empire — the largest in the world at that time.
Over a 10-year period, fighting across modern-day Turkey, the Middle East, and as far away as Afghanistan and Pakistan, Alexander routed Persian king Darius III, taking the empire for his own.
His territory now extended from the Adriatic Sea to the Indus River — and he was only 30.
From there, he pressed on into the Indian subcontinent and into modern-day Pakistan's Punjab province, where he made further conquests, pushing into modern-day India, before his weary army rebelled.
They turned back but on the way home, Alexander was struck by a two-week fever and died in Babylon.
His body was taken to Egypt and was said to have been entombed in Alexandria, where it was venerated by everyone from Cleopatra to Julius Caesar, before disappearing in around the fifth century.
It has never been found.
Alexander died without having ever lost a battle, and while his empire soon splintered, for centuries, the official language of administration in the area remained Greek.
“That's why Greek spread all over the Middle East, and why the New Testament is written in Greek,” says Cartledge.
While he was hated by many Athenians, who believed in democracy not monarchies or empires — and while, Cartledge says, some followers of Zoroastrianism, an ancient monotheistic religion, still think of him as evil for destroying their ancient records in Persepolis, modern-day Iran — since his death Alexander has achieved an almost god-like status.
For Cartledge, Alexander was unique.
“It takes an exceptional personality to preside over what he did,” he says, citing Genghis Khan as one of the few leaders of his caliber.

Alexander's legacy is no stuffy history lesson.
In fact, the story of the young man from Macedonia who pushed to the boundaries of the world has had fans from the word go.
In the Roman period, writers including Arrian and Plutarch composed biographies of Alexander.
Next, the “Alexander Romance” — first written in third-century Alexandria in Egypt — became hugely popular.
Essentially a novel based on his life, it was translated into languages including Arabic and Persian — “every language in the world,” according to Pierre Briant, professor emeritus at the Collège de France, “The Achaemenid empire and Alexander's empire” chair.
In 1010 CE, Persian poet Firdawsi wrote “Shahnamah,” the “Book of Kings,” which portrayed Alexander as Sikander, a Persian, and half-brother to Dara, or Darius.
In this, Alexander preserves Persia's Zoroastrian religion.
Briant says the book went “everywhere in the Middle and Far East” — even to Indonesia.
Today, cities from Alexandria in Egypt to Kandahar in Afghanistan are named for Alexander.
##### Alexander's 'great' legacy around the world .

“I think it's a combination of his age — he did so much before he died — and the extraordinary distance that he traveled,” says Cartledge.
“He got as far as modern-day Afghanistan, Pakistan, a bit of India.
He didn't always go through very nicely, but he triumphed over ever possible obstacle: a mountain, a river, war elephants, scythed chariots.
Everything that was thrown at him, he overcame.”.
Even today, people are catching the Alexander bug.
“When I was a teenager I hated history,” says Peter Sommer, a UK tour operator who owes his career to Alexander.
At school, Sommer planned to specialize in sciences, but one day his history teacher showed pupils a map of Alexander's travels.
“My jaw fell open, hit the desk, and I went home and said, 'I want to study ancient history,'” he says.
He changed his courses and went on to study ancient history and archaeology at university, writing his undergraduate thesis and masters dissertation on Alexander-related topics.
He also embarked on a four-and-a-half-month, 2,000-mile hike through modern-day Turkey, recreating Alexander's progress from the ancient city of Troy to the location of the Battle of Issus in modern-day Anatolia, where he first beat Darius.
“I thought, 'How can I understand Alexander if I haven't been to the places?'” he says.
“I'd never traveled before, but I fell in love with travel and with Turkey.”.
Having completed a similar project for the BBC, he launched his own tour company, Peter Sommer Travels , taking small groups on cultural, archaeological and food itineraries.
Sommer has run Alexander-themed tours across Turkey and Greece, and says his clients on those tours are “totally mixed.”
While you might imagine that tours following in the steps of a great warrior might be male-focused, Sommer says that “we have lots of female travelers who are completely nuts about Alexander.”.
Perhaps that's because of his rather 21st-century approach to women.
Unlike ancient conquerors who took rape and pillage as their right in victory, Alexander tended to stick to the latter and eschew the former.
In one memorable story, having defeated Darius (who fled) at the Battle of Issus, Alexander captured the Persian royals, including Darius' wife and mother.
Instead of enslaving them, as might have been expected, he treated them with dignity.
Sisygambis, Darius' mother, came to love Alexander as a second son, and even died of grief after his death, the story goes.
What ancient figure could be more suited to a 21st-century audience than this unlikely respectful king?.
Sommer says his clients on the Alexander tours are “total Alexander enthusiasts… they wanted to talk about him at every lunch, every dinner.”.
He puts it down to Alexander's “charisma” that still shines through the centuries.
“What fascinated me is how someone could do all this by the age of 32,” he says.
“To have had the biggest military campaign ever.
To lead from the front, up to 100,000 troops.
His charisma must have been extraordinary.”.
For his clients, traveling in the footsteps of Alexander can be emotional.
One, who writes the Mega Alexandros blog but prefers to stay anonymous for privacy reasons, recalls an “unforgettable” drive through Iran's Zagros mountains when a sandstorm swept up from Mesapotamia, Iraq.
“The bus stopped and sand was in my face, pulling at my clothes,” they say.
“I thought, Alexander must have had such days.
They had to march through that.
'” In Uzbekistan, on an eight-hour bus ride from Tashkent to Bukhara, they thought, “My god, how did they do it?
I couldn't move at the pace his soldiers walked.
When you're on the spot and see the landscape, it's totally different.
You learn to look at the landscape because they had to.
For me there's nothing that can replace that.”.
Alexander has joined an elite group of usually mythical figures whose characters shapeshift along with society's beliefs and desires.
“The histories keep changing,” says Sommer.
“He gets written up completely differently according to the time.
He's like a renaissance man that people interpret for themselves.”.
Cartledge says “We project our dreams, fantasies and nightmares on people we call great.
They're by no means always good, but they achieve something way beyond what you or I possibly could.”.
But Cartledge also says Alexander was a great propagandist.
Two thousand years on, we still largely believe 'his' side of the story.
He even linked himself to Homer's mythical hero Achilles, adding romantic and homoerotic sides to his legacy.
Although he thinks Alexander's episodes of slaughter — especially towards the end of his campaign — are a “a real stain on his memory,” Cartledge says “I admire him intensely.
He was very brave, charismatic, had very great qualities, but also did some absolutely awful things.
He was unique.”.
One person who interprets Alexander a little differently from most is Briant.
An expert on both the Macedonian and the Achaemenid (Persian) empires, and author of A short introduction: Alexander the Great , Briant bristles at the idea that Alexander achieved something that had never been done before.
The clue, he says, is in what Alexander did: conquer the Persian Empire.
“You can't speak of Alexander alone as if he were a kind of supernatural person and without any context,” he says.
“If you speak of conquests, you have to speak about the Achaemenid Empire.
The Persian king had conquered Persia 200 years earlier, so when Alexander came to conquer the Middle East he had to conquer an organized empire.
He was not the first.”.
In fact, says Briant, there's a simple reason why, 2,000 years on, we talk about Alexander but not Cyrus the Great, who founded the Achaemenid Empire in 550 BCE: racism.
“We are Europe-focused,” he says of historians.
“Alexander has taken an enormous place in European thought from antiquity to the modern era.
He was considered the first conqueror of the east… a precedent for European conquerors.
Some 18th and 19th-century historians explained his victories as announcing the future victories of European armies against the Ottomans.
It has become a kind of European political myth, and very important for European thoughts about Asia and the Middle East.
” One of his books looks at the concept of Alexander as the “ First European .” .
Greek and Roman authors weren't interested in the Persian Empire, he says — meaning that even from antiquity, it was effectively erased from history.
“When I speak with colleagues, especially from the US, working on Alexander, I ask, 'Why are you not interested in the history of the Persian Empire?' Some respond, “It's too difficult, it's another world.
' In fact it's the same world,” he says.
He calls Oliver Stone's 2004 film, “Alexander,” starring Colin Farrell, “completely foolish” for its lack of Persian context.
Briant even rubbishes the idea of the Hellenization of the east that took place after Alexander — when Greek became the official language.
“This didn't mean the local culture disappeared — quite the contrary,” he says, adding that everyone from the Egyptians to the Babylonians used their own language, too.
Instead, he calls it a “meeting of cultures:” something that Alexander — who appalled his troops by dressing in Persian robes, married a woman from what is now known as Afghanistan (Roxana), and buffered his army with Persian soldiers — would surely have approved of.
While today we see Alexander's behavior as multiculturalism, in reality it was political, says Briant.
“Alexander was fighting for 13 years —- his main concern was maintaining an army,” he says.
“By the end the army was mainly Iranian, and maybe he was concerned about culture, but the main point was to maintain military forces.”
The same goes for his marriage to Roxana, which Briant calls “political,” About Alexander's legendary treatment of Sisygambis, Cartledge agrees Alexander “wanted [the Persian royals] to buy into the new order.”.
Although Briant acknowledges Alexander's brilliance on the battlefield, his courage and intelligence, he emphasizes that the Macedonian wasn't conquering brand-new territory, mile by mile, but a pre-existing empire.
“He conquered the Persian empire and its frontiers — it was his main goal,” says Briant.
“That's why it's important to know about the Persian Empire.
You can't understand Alexander if you don't understand Darius, the last king of the Persian Empire.”.
Not for nothing is one of his books “ Darius in the shadow of Alexander .” .
Rather than Alexander or even Darius III, Briant says the man we should be venerating is Darius I, “the main conqueror and organizer of the empire.”
Thousands of clay tablets found in Persepolis, in modern-day Iran, are finally being translated — and they show his importance, he says.
Cartledge — author of “Alexander the Great” — agrees that Darius I was a formidable ruler, who tolerated other religions.
“But I'd say as a Greek historian that the impact of Alexander taking over what Darius had created made [the empire] even more amazing,” he says.
“He transmitted a Greco-Persian culture.
Darius was an amazing figure but I'd say Alexander's achievement was even greater.” .
Visitors to modern-day Iran can see remains of the empire at Persepolis, Susa and Pasargadae, the first capital of the Achaemenid Empire.
While in northern Greece you'll find Pella, the ruined city where Alexander was born, as well as the tomb of Philip and other Macedonian royals in a spectacular underground museum at Vergina (ancient Aigai), and the newly opened royal palace above.
A little further south, at the foot of Mount Olympus (the most sacred site in Ancient Greece) is Dion, where Alexander made sacrifices to the god Zeus before setting out for Persia.
And east of Aigai, past Thessaloniki (which was named for Alexander's half-sister) is Philippi, renamed by Philip after he conquered it.
There, an inscription in the museum bears a missive from Alexander ruling on a boundary dispute.
In Turkey, Sommer recommends the Istanbul Archaeology Museums, where there are two statues of Alexander as well as the Alexander Sarcophagus , a fourth-century BCE sarcophagus found in Lebanon, intricately carved with scenes from the life of the king.
Myths and as yet unproven theories also link him to other sites across the northern hemisphere.
The ancient Thracian city of Perperikon, perched on a hilltop, in Bulgaria is said to be the legendary Oracle of Dionysus, where Alexander is said to have been told he would conquer the world, before setting out for Persia.
And some even believe that his bones were stolen from Alexandria by Venetians, who mistook them for the relics of St. Mark, which they ransacked from the Egyptian city and took home.
Could they be the remains guarded closely in St. Mark's Basilica in Venice?.
Nobody knows what Alexander was planning when he died, though it's thought he was eying the Persian Gulf and more of northern Africa.
But his legend has lived on.
And despite his flaws, perhaps we could all be a little bit more Alexander.
“He didn't spare himself.
He didn't play the long game.
He tried to achieve as much as he could in the shortest possible time, possibly realizing he was going to die early,” says Cartledge.
For his fans, he is an inspiration across the centuries.
“Alexander was a driven person,” says the Mega Alexandros blogger.
“He went off to his end of the rainbow — and he never doubted he would reach it.”.

Title: Trump shrugs off Elon Musk's criticism of AI announcement: 'He hates one of the people' | CNN Business
# Trump shrugs off Elon Musk's criticism of AI announcement: 'He hates one of the people' | CNN Business.
CNN — .
President Donald Trump on Thursday shrugged off an ugly back-and-forth between tech CEOs Elon Musk and Sam Altman that pitted one of Trump's most visible lieutenants against a key participant in a massive $500 billion AI project Trump announced Tuesday.
Musk had undercut Trump's Tuesday Oval Office AI announcement, casting doubt on his X social media platform that any of the participating companies had the money to fund it.
But Trump Thursday told reporters at the White House that Musk's commentary was just a case of bad blood, because he “hates one of the people in the deal” - not an indictment of the viability of the deal he had announced.
“No, he hates one of the people,” Trump said, in an apparent reference to Altman.
“I've spoken to Elon, but—spoken to all of them, actually.
The people in the deal are very, very smart people- but Elon, one of the people he happens to hate.
But I have certain hatreds of people too.”.
Shortly after Trump announced the new massive AI infrastructure investment between Altman's OpenAI, Oracle and Softbank, Musk wrote on his social media platform X, “They don't actually have the money.
SoftBank has well under $10B secured.
I have that on good authority.”.
Pressed on Musk's comments Thursday, Trump told reporters, “I don't know if they do, but you know, they're putting up the money- the government's not putting up anything, they're putting up money.
They're very rich people, so I hope they do.”.
Trump had announced the investment will create a new company, called Stargate, to grow artificial intelligence infrastructure in the United States.
The leaders of SoftBank, OpenAI and Oracle stood alongside Trump during the announcement.
Their respective companies will invest $100 billion in total for the project to start, with plans to pour up to $500 billion into Stargate in the coming years.
Following the post, Altman and Musk have traded barbs on the platform , with Musk, who's in an ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI, sharing former posts critical of Trump from Altman to his own X page.
Asked in a follow-up exchange if he was frustrated with Musk's very public criticism of the AI announcement he helped broker, Trump demurred Thursday.
Musk's barbs represented a notable takedown of a major White House project from someone that is in Trump's innermost circle.
As a sign of how involved Musk is in the first days of the administration, Musk said he was in the Oval Office on Tuesday as Trump signed a pardon for Ross William Ulbricht, founder of the dark web marketplace SilkRoad.
Musk had also dispatched a top staffer from his SpaceX and X companies to help ensure the release of convicted January 6 rioters after Trump signed a blanket pardon.
But perhaps it should not be a surprise that Musk is going after an OpenAI initiative.
Musk is in an ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman, who was at the White House for the announcement.
Musk, who has said he “doesn't trust” Altman, claims in the lawsuit the ChatGPT has abandoned its original nonprofit mission by reserving some of its most advanced AI technology for private customers.
The companies involved in Stargate have not publicly disclosed how they will contribute the funds, but they don't necessarily need the money in the bank to support it — they could raise debt or sign on other equity investors.
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Wednesday rebuffed Musk's comments, saying in a Fox News interview, “the American people should take President Trump and those CEOs' words for it.”.
CNN's Hadas Gold contributed to this report.

Title: Analysis: DeepSeek's AI is giving the world a window into Chinese censorship and information control | CNN
# Analysis: DeepSeek's AI is giving the world a window into Chinese censorship and information control | CNN.
Hong Kong CNN — .
Previously little-known Chinese startup DeepSeek has dominated headlines and app charts in recent days thanks to its new AI chatbot , which sparked a global tech sell-off that wiped billions off Silicon Valley's biggest companies and shattered assumptions of America's dominance of the tech race.
But those signing up for the chatbot and its open-source technology are being confronted with the Chinese Communist Party's brand of censorship and information control.
Ask DeepSeek's newest AI model, unveiled last week, to do things like explain who is winning the AI race, summarize the latest executive orders from the White House or tell a joke and a user will get similar answers to the ones spewed out by American-made rivals OpenAI's GPT-4, Meta's Llama or Google's Gemini.
Yet when questions veer into territory that would be restricted or heavily moderated on China's domestic internet, the responses reveal aspects of the country's tight information controls.
Using the internet in the world's second most populous country is to cross what's often dubbed the “Great Firewall” and enter a completely separate internet eco-system policed by armies of censors, where most major Western social media and search platforms are blocked.
The country routinely ranks among the most restrictive for internet and speech freedoms in reports from global watchdogs .
The international popularity of Chinese apps like TikTok and RedNote have already raised national security concerns among Western governments - as well as questions about the potential impact to free speech and Beijing's ability to shape global narratives and public opinion.
Now, the introduction of DeepSeek's AI assistant - which is free and rocketed to the top of app charts in recent days - raises the urgency of those questions, observers say, and spotlights the online ecosystem from which they have emerged.
One example of a question DeepSeek's new bot, using its R1 model, will answer differently than a Western rival?
The Tiananmen Square massacre on June 4, 1989, when the Chinese government brutally cracked down on student protesters in Beijing and across the country, killing hundreds if not thousands of students in the capital, according to estimates from rights groups.
Chinese authorities have so thoroughly suppressed discussion of the massacre in the decades since that many people in China grow up never having heard about it.
A search for 'what happened on June 4, 1989 in Beijing' on major Chinese online search platform Baidu turns up articles noting that June 4 is the 155th day in the Gregorian calendar or a link to a state media article noting authorities that year “quelled counter-revolutionary riots” - with no mention of Tiananmen.
When the same query is put to DeepSeek's newest AI assistant, it begins to give an answer detailing some of the events, including a “military crackdown,” before erasing it and replying that it's “not sure how to approach this type of question yet.”
“Let's chat about math, coding and logic problems instead,” it says.
When asked the same question in Chinese, the app is faster - immediately apologizing for not knowing how to answer.
It's a similar patten when asking the R1 bot - DeepSeek's newest model - “what happened in Hong Kong in 2019,” when the city was rocked by pro-democracy protests.
First it gives a detailed overview of events with a conclusion that at least during one test noted - as Western observers have - that Beijing's subsequent imposition of a National Security Law on the city led to a “significant erosion of civil liberties.”
But quickly after or amid its response, the bot erases its own answer and suggests talking about something else.
DeepSeek's V3 bot, released late last year weeks prior to R1, returns different answers, including ones that appear to rely more heavily on China's official stance.
When asked about its sources, DeepSeek's R1 bot said it used a “diverse dataset of publicly available texts,” including both Chinese state media and international sources.
“Critical thinking and cross-referencing remain key when navigating politically charged subjects,” it said.
CNN has approached the company for comment.
Observers say that these differences have significant implications for free speech and the shaping of global public opinion.
That spotlights another dimension of the battle for tech dominance: who gets to control the narrative on major global issues, and history itself.
An audit by US-based information reliability analytics firm NewsGuard released Wednesday said DeepSeek's older V3 chatbot model failed to provide accurate information about news and information topics 83% of the time, ranking it tied for 10th out of 11 in comparison to its leading Western competitors.
It's not clear how the newer R1 stacks up, however.
DeepSeek becoming a global AI leader could have “catastrophic” consequences, said China analyst Isaac Stone Fish.
“It would be incredibly dangerous for free speech and free thought globally, because it hives off the ability to think openly, creatively and, in many cases, correctly about one of the most important entities in the world, which is China,” said Fish, who is the founder of business intelligence firm Strategy Risks.
That's because the app, when asked about the country or its leaders, “present China like the utopian Communist state that has never existed and will never exist,” he added.
In mainland China, the ruling Chinese Communist Party has ultimate authority over what information and images can and cannot be shown - part of their iron-fisted efforts to maintain control over society and suppress all forms of dissent.
And tech companies like DeepSeek have no choice but to follow the rules.
Because the technology was developed in China, its model is going to be collecting more China-centric or pro-China data than a Western firm, a reality which will likely impact the platform, according to Aaron Snoswell, a senior research fellow in AI accountability at the Queensland University of Technology Generative AI Lab.
The company itself, like all AI firms, will also set various rules to trigger set responses when words or topics that the platform doesn't want to discuss arise, Snoswell said, pointing to examples like Tiananmen Square.
In addition, AI companies often use workers to help train the model in what kinds of topics may be taboo or okay to discuss and where certain boundaries are, a process called “reinforcement learning from human feedback” that DeepSeek said in a research paper it used.
“That means someone in DeepSeek wrote a policy document that says, 'here are the topics that are okay and here are the topics that are not okay.' They gave that to their workers … and then that behavior would have been embedded into the model,” he said.
US AI chatbots also generally have parameters - for example ChatGPT won't tell a user how to make a bomb or fabricate a 3D gun, and they typically use mechanisms like reinforcement learning to create guardrails against hate speech, for example.
“That's how every other company makes these models behave better,” Snoswell said.
“But it's just that in this case, chances are that a Chinese company embedded (China's official) values into their policy.”.
There have also been questions raised about potential security risks linked to DeepSeek's platform, which the White House on Tuesday said it was investigating for national security implications.
Concerns about American data being in the hands of Chinese firms is already a hot button issue in Washington, fueling the controversy over social media app TikTok.
The app's Chinese parent company ByteDance is being required by law to divest TikTok's American business, though the enforcement of this was paused by Trump.
Unlike TikTok, which says as of July 2022 it stores all American data in the US, DeepSeek says in its privacy policy that personal information it collects is stored in “secure servers located in the People's Republic of China.” .
A comparison of privacy policies between DeepSeek and some of its US competitors also show concerning differences, according to Snoswell.
Each DeepSeek, OpenAI and Meta say they collect people's data such as from their account information, activities on the platforms and the devices they're using.
But DeepSeek adds that it also collects “keystroke patterns or rhythms,” which can be as uniquely identifying as a fingerprint or facial recognition and used a biometric.
“I've never seen another software platform that says they collect that unless it's designed for (those purposes),” Snoswell said.
He also noted what appeared to be vaguely defined allowances for sharing of user data to entities within DeepSeek's corporate group.
“It's way, way more permissive than anything you'd see from a Western software company,” he said.

Hong Kong CNN — .
President Donald Trump has finally made good on a campaign promise to raise tariffs on Chinese imports - announcing on Saturday duties of 10% on all Chinese goods coming in the country as part of sweeping trade measures that also targeted Mexico and Canada.
Now the question for Chinese leaders is how strongly to retaliate.
In the wake of the announcement, Chinese officials - who were hit by Trump's move while in the middle of a week-long public holiday - vowed to file a complaint with the World Trade Organization and “take corresponding countermeasures” without specifying in what form.
The imposition of a 10% tariff on Chinese goods imported into the United States “seriously violates the WTO rules,” China's Ministry of Commerce said in a statement Sunday, adding that China will “resolutely defend its rights.”.
That response, at least so far, has been noticeably less concrete than the ones from Mexico and Canada, which were both quick to pledge swift retaliatory tariffs.
The latest announcement raises a 10% tariff on Chinese products, rather than the 25% on all goods from Mexico and most from Canada - all are expected to go into effect Tuesday.
Unlike for China, where the latest tariffs top existing ones on a swath of goods, Canada and Mexico previously enjoyed nearly a duty-free relationship with the US.
But there are other reasons besides the number next to the percentage sign and China's public holiday that could account for the comparatively mild response from the world's second largest economy.
Beijing has enjoyed an unexpectedly warm start to Trump's second term - a welcome development for Chinese leaders as they seek to avoid escalating trade and tech frictions at the same time as the export-reliant country's economy slows.
Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Trump had what the US leader called a “very good” phone call days before Trump took office, and his inaugural ceremony was attended by the highest-level Chinese official to ever be dispatched to such an event.
The US president has also sent other signals he's in dealmaking mode with Beijing - saying repeatedly he hopes to work with Xi on resolving Russia's war in Ukraine and suggesting in a recent interview with Fox News that he thought Washington and Beijiing could reach a trade deal.
While the president campaigned on winning economic competition with China and stacked his administration with a bevy of China hawks, the recent tone may suggest to Beijing that it's better not to escalate too extensively, at least not yet.
The 10% tariffs are a far cry from the upwards of 60% tariffs that Trump suggested he could levy on Chinese goods while on the campaign trail.
Trump has - at least in his rhetoric - largely linked these duties to the role of Chinese suppliers in the fentanyl trade, not the gaping trade imbalance between the US and China.
Instead, the expectation within China has been that Trump may be biding his time until he receives the results of a larger probe into US-China economic and trade relations that he commissioned in an executive order signed on his first day in office.
“Trump may rely on the upcoming results of trade investigations to impose or expand tariffs on specific countries, testing their tolerance and willingness to negotiate,” an analysis published Sunday on the website of Shanghai-based think tank Fudan Development Institute said.
“The risk of escalating into a 'full-blown trade war' cannot be ruled out.
Before any actual actions are taken, Trump can still use ambiguous strategies to pressure opponents and wait for substantive concessions from them,” it continued.
The Trump-ordered review, due April 1, is expected to guide whether the White House imposes further duties on China.
In the meantime, Beijing has time to build a relationship with Trump, entertain him in the Chinese capital or push for a preemptive deal to avert more severe economic penalties.
The message from China's top political echelon has been conciliatory.
Chinese Vice-Premier Ding Xuexiang last month told elites gathered in Davos that Beijing wants to “promote balanced trade” with the world, while Xi called for a “new starting point” in US-China ties.
Beijing's decision to complain to the WTO about the new tariffs underscores a key message from Chinese Communist Party propagandists: that China plays by global rules, while the US is the one who does not.
Beijing has also defended its efforts to control exports of precursor chemicals for fentanyl and said the drug crisis is “America's problem.”.
It remains to be seen whether China will announce more trade countermeasures in the days ahead.
But its initial response to the 10% duty and messaging in recent weeks suggests that it may still be in a wait-and-see mode before digging too deeply into its toolbox of retaliatory measures.
An opinion piece published by state broadcaster CCTV Sunday decried the “erroneous” tariffs while also calling for more cooperation between the two countries.
Pundits within the country have downplayed the impact of the 10% tariffs - amid a larger debate about whether it would serve China to escalate a trade war like during the first administration.
In 2018, Trump heightened or imposed tariffs on hundreds of billions of Chinese imports to the US, with Beijing hitting back with what analysts say were some $185 billion of its own tariffs on US goods.
The Biden administration largely kept those duties in place, while focusing on its own so-called “small yard, high fence” approach to trade with China - placing targeted export controls on Chinese access to high tech that could have military applications.
That saw Beijing unleash its own controls - limiting the export of certain critical minerals and related technologies that countries rely on to fabricate products from military goods to semiconductors.
Late last year, the country revamped its export control regulations, sharpening its ability to restrict so-called dual-use goods.
A ramping up of the use of these controls, as well as retaliatory tariffs, could be moves for Beijing in the weeks ahead or if Trump does levy higher tariffs in the coming months.
Meanwhile, Beijing has already taken steps to insulate itself from some of the impacts of the tariffs, which Trump himself has admitted could bring “pain” for Americans - an admission that follows concerns from economists and members of Congress that Americans will bear the cost of the measures.
The US imported $401 billion worth of goods from China, with a trade deficit of over $270 billion in the first 11 months of last year, according to US government data.
That placed China behind only Mexico as a top source for goods imported to the US.
Chinese state media on Sunday said the country's exports to the US account for only 3% of their GDP and less than 15% of China's total exports.
“China has long been preparing less exposure to the US, diversifying in all ways, not just in terms of trading partners, investment, but also currencies and payment system,” Keyu Jin, associate professor of economics at the London School of Economics told CNN's Fareed Zarakia during the World Economic Forum in Davos last month.
“The tariffs will hurt both countries.
But you've seen already a gradual kind of redirection of trade to other countries (from Chinese companies),” Jin said.
China sees “Trump as somebody who they can negotiate with, that there's room for negotiation,” she added.

Title: Sam Altman returns to OpenAI in a bizarre reversal of fortunes | CNN Business
# Sam Altman returns to OpenAI in a bizarre reversal of fortunes | CNN Business.
New York CNN — .
Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry.
“We have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,” the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce.
Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO Adam D'Angelo.
“We are collaborating to figure out the details,” it said.
In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is “looking forward” to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm's “strong partnership” with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker's biggest financial backer.
The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving.
The details of Altman's firing and re-hiring remain murky.
In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently “candid” with the board.
That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying.
But a key factor in Altman's ouster was the presence of tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously, according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher, who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis.
As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division.
OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO.
But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company's entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company's board didn't resign and reinstate Altman as CEO.
It's unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman's return.
Posting on X, Shear wrote: “I am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work …
I'm glad to have been a part of the solution.”.
Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. .
Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision.
And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades.
“We are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said on X. “We believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.” .
Altman's vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out.
Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI , and he has pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly.
“Is [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?” he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation.
“Or is it gonna be more like the atom bomb — huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?” .
But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit.
Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI's first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT.
OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft's products.
OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly been in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone.

Title: CBS staff alarmed by reports of settlement talks with Trump over '60 Minutes' Harris interview | CNN Business
# CBS staff alarmed by reports of settlement talks with Trump over '60 Minutes' Harris interview | CNN Business.
CNN — .
Journalists, including some at CBS News, are expressing alarm at reports that CBS parent company Paramount Global is trying to settle a legally dubious lawsuit lodged by President Donald Trump last fall.
Trump sued CBS after an October “60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris - Trump's opponent in the presidential campaign - included an edit that Trump said was unfairly favorable to Harris.
Despite legal experts' widespread assertion that CBS' editorial judgment was protected by the First Amendment, The New York Times Thursday night reported that a settlement was in the works.
That sparked outage in CBS' newsroom.
“Trump's lawsuit was a joke, but if we settle, we become the laughingstock,” a CBS correspondent said on condition of anonymity.
CBS in October called the suit meritless and said at the time “we will vigorously defend against it.”
A Paramount spokesperson on Friday declined to comment.
A lawyer for Trump, Edward Paltzik, did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but he told The Times that “real accountability for CBS and Paramount will ensure that the president is compensated for the harm done to him.”.
The Times noted that “a settlement would be an extraordinary concession by a major U.S. media company to a sitting president, especially in a case in which there is no evidence that the network got facts wrong or damaged the plaintiff's reputation.”.
Indeed, a settlement by Paramount could look like a payoff.
Specifically, it would look like a big check to Trump (or his presidential library, following in ABC and Meta's footsteps) in exchange for regulatory approval of Paramount's pending deal with Skydance Media.
“That's called a bribe,” Richard Painter, a former White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, commented on X .
Is it the cost of doing business in the Trump era?
Some business leaders appear to believe so.
But settling with Trump would also cost CBS some of its hard-won credibility.
The suit stemmed from “60 Minutes” correspondent Bill Whitaker's sit-down last October with Harris.
Observers noticed that CBS aired two different answers from Harris to a single question about why Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was “not listening” to the United States.
The answer Harris gave in a preview clip differed from the answer she gave on the actual “60 Minutes” broadcast.
Trump and his allies claimed that CBS had manipulated the interview to make the vice president look better.
As criticism mounted and Trump threatened to sue, CBS said there was nothing nefarious about the editing;
“the interview was not doctored,” and the newsmagazine “did not hide any part of the Vice President's answer to the question at issue,” CBS News senior VP for legal affairs Gayle C. Sproul said.
Sproul also cited case law that defends editing and news judgments, noting that “editing is a necessity for all broadcasters to enable them to present the news in the time available, and that is what '60 Minutes' did here, as it does with its other reports.”.
Trump sued anyway.
His lawyers filed a complaint in US District Court in the Northern District of Texas, alleging CBS violated the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act, a consumer protection law.
Legal experts contacted by CNN at the time called the suit “frivolous;”
“ridiculous junk;” and laughable on its face.
From the alleged damages ( $10 billion! ) to the decision to give Fox News the scoop about the suit, it had all the hallmarks of a political PR stunt.
But a few days after the suit was filed, Trump won the election.
All of a sudden, the suit posed a serious threat to the news division's parent company, Paramount Global, according to a person involved in the matter.
That's because the merger requires the blessing of the Trump administration, in part because CBS owns local stations that are licensed by the Federal Communications Commission, known as the FCC.
Outside analysts, citing Trump's transactional nature, predicted that Paramount may have a hard time getting the necessary federal approvals.
Brendan Carr, who Trump promoted to chair the FCC, recently revived a pro-Trump group's complaint about the “60 Minutes” interview.
Back in November, he said the complaint would probably factor into the agency's review of the Paramount-Skydance deal.
On Friday, CBS confirmed that the FCC sent the company a “letter of inquiry” asking the network to hand over the unedited transcript and tapes of the Harris interview.
“We are working to comply with that inquiry as we are legally compelled to do,” a CBS spokesperson told CNN.
As an FCC license-holder, CBS is obliged to respond to reasonable requests from the government agency.
But those requests are typically about technicalities like broadcast transmission signals, not the raw materials of a news program like “60 Minutes.”.
The notion of Paramount caving to Trump has sparked condemnation.
After the Wall Street Journal two weeks ago reported that settlement talks were a possibility, Sen. Bernie Sanders urged CBS to “stand tall.” .
Sanders wrote on X , “CBS may be reaching a legal settlement with Trump because he didn't like how a campaign interview with Kamala was edited.
Really?
If CBS caves, the belief that we have an independent media protected by the First Amendment is undermined.” .
Trump's history of bullying media companies suggests that a payout by Paramount won't stop his pressure campaigns.
In the weeks before his inauguration, ABC agreed to donate $15 million to Trump's future presidential library to settle a defamation lawsuit against the network.
Earlier this week Meta agreed to a $22 million payout over another Trump lawsuit.

Title: Whole Foods union: Workers at Philadelphia store vote to form first union for Amazon-owned supermarket chain | CNN Business
# Whole Foods union: Workers at Philadelphia store vote to form first union for Amazon-owned supermarket chain | CNN Business.
CNN — .
Workers at a Pennsylvania Whole Foods store voted on Monday to unionize, forming the first union in the organic grocery chain owned by Amazon.
A majority of the employees at the flagship store in Philadelphia's Center City neighborhood voted to join a local chapter of the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW), which represents hundreds of thousands of employees at grocery chains nationwide.
The union said 130 workers voted in favor and 100 workers voted against the move.
In a statement to CNN, the union local chapter called the vote “a significant victory in their fight for fair wages, improved benefits, and a safer, more supportive workplace,” claiming the workers faced anti-union pressure and intimidation from Amazon in the lead-up to the vote.
“This fight is far from over, but today's victory is an important step forward,” said chapter President Wendell Young IV.
“We are ready to bring Whole Foods to the bargaining table to negotiate a fair first contract that reflects the workers' needs and priorities.”.
Whole Foods said in a statement it was “disappointed” by the results of the vote, but assured it was “committed to maintaining a positive working environment in our Philly Center City store.”.
The company added it “is proud to offer competitive compensation, great benefits, and career advancement opportunities to all Team Members.”.
Amazon has faced - and fought - several unionizing initiatives at its different businesses, most notably at its warehouses and delivery drivers.
In one case, the workers succeeded in approving a union at a Staten Island warehouse, but the company has not joined the bargaining table so far.
Delivery drivers have succeeded in unionizing in a few states, among them California, New York and Georgia.
In November, when the Philadelphia workers first filed their formal petition to hold the union vote, UFCW said in a statement they were fighting for better compensation and working conditions at “one of the most profitable organic grocers in the world.”.
Some employees at the Philadelphia location had worked for the supermarket chain for decades, the statement said - but many still “struggle to afford rent, healthcare, childcare, and other basic necessities.”.
“I believe workers' rights are definitely under threat and this is one way we can fight back,” one Whole Foods worker named Leeya said in an Instagram video posted by a group of workers at the Center City store.
Another worker, identified as Ben, pointed to the rising cost of living.
“We need improvement to our actual material conditions,” he said in the video, which was shared the day before the vote.
Several of the workers in the video complained of alleged union busting, claiming that Whole Foods management in recent months had pushed anti-union messaging, changed the staffing of the store, and tried to raise morale without addressing the workers' demands.
Earlier this month, the local chapter of UFCW also filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board against Whole Foods, alleging the company had threatened and discriminated against pro-union employees and spied on their union activities - all violations of US labor law.
Last Thursday, just days before the vote, three US representatives from Pennsylvania issued a letter to Whole Foods CEO Jason Buechel and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, expressing concern over reports that workers were facing “various forms of obstruction by … management as they exercise their legal right to attempt to unionize.” .
The lawmakers urged Whole Foods to allow the vote without interference and to respect the results.

Some 30 meters (98 feet) below central London lies a mile-long network of tunnels that is set to be the UK capital's glitziest new tourist attraction, according to the company that's secured planning approval for the $149 million transformation .
The Kingsway Exchange Tunnels were built in the 1940s to shelter Londoners from the Blitz bombing campaign during World War II.
That was the last time they were open to the general public.
Their next wartime role was as the home of Britain's top-secret Special Operations Executive, an offshoot of MI6 and the real-life inspiration for James Bond's Q Branch.
The new attraction will be a memorial to the Blitz, which Angus Murray, chief executive of the London Tunnels, told Reuters will be part museum, part exhibition and part entertainment space.
The plan is to open to the public by late 2027 or early 2028.

Title: Microsoft stock hits all-time high after hiring former OpenAI CEO Sam Altman | CNN Business
# Microsoft stock hits all-time high after hiring former OpenAI CEO Sam Altman | CNN Business.
New York CNN — .
Microsoft stock reached a record high on Monday after the company said that Sam Altman, former chief executive of OpenAI, will join the company to head its artificial intelligence innovation leg.
Shares of the tech behemoth rose 2.1% to an all-time high close of $377.44 on Monday, beating the previous record of $376.17..
That comes after shares of Microsoft fell 1.7% on Friday, when Sam Altman was ousted from his position at OpenAI in a boardroom coup.
Microsoft is the artificial intelligence firm's biggest stakeholder, with a $13 billion investment in the company.
Greg Brockman, who co-founded OpenAI and quit after Altman's firing, is also joining Microsoft.
Altman's hiring ended days of speculation that the former chief executive could return to the firm after his dramatic firing.
Emmett Shear, former CEO of Amazon-owned streaming service Twitch, will replace OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati as interim chief executive.
Microsoft shares are up about 56% for the year.
The stock is one of the “Magnificent Seven” that have powered the lion's share of the market's returns this year, boosted by Wall Street's bet that artificial intelligence is the next big thing in tech.
Dan Ives, tech analyst at Wedbush Securities, reiterated his $425 price target for Microsoft's stock following Altman's and Brockman's hires.
“We view Microsoft now even in a stronger position from an AI perspective with Altman and Brockman” at the company, Ives wrote in a note on Monday.
Other members of the “Magnificent Seven” saw a boost on Monday.
Nvidia shares gained 2.3% to end the trading session at $504.20 ahead of its earnings due on Tuesday, notching a record-high close for the chipmaker.

Title: Google Maps will change the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America | CNN Business
# Google Maps will change the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America | CNN Business.
New York CNN — .
Google is complying with President Donald Trump's executive action that renamed the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America.
Soon, the name change will appear on Google Maps.
In a post on X, Google explained that it has a “longstanding practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government sources.”
The name will be tweaked when the Geographic Names Information System, a government database of names and location data, is updated.
Google will also change the name of Mount McKinley, the nation's highest peak, from Denali.
Former President Barack Obama renamed the Alaska landmark to Denali in 2015 as a nod to the region's native population.
Both changes stem from an executive action that Trump signed shortly after taking office last week, saying the changes “honor American greatness.”.
“It is in the national interest to promote the extraordinary heritage of our Nation and ensure future generations of American citizens celebrate the legacy of our American heroes,” the executive order said.
The order criticized Obama's decision to rename McKinley as “an affront to President McKinley's life, his achievements, and his sacrifice.”
Drawing parallels to Trump, the order notes that McKinley “championed tariffs” and was assassinated “in an attack on our Nation's values and our success.”.
And in a nod to the Gulf of Mexico's contributions to the US economy, Trump is “directing that it officially be renamed the Gulf of America.”
The executive order calls for all federal government maps and documents to “reflect its renaming.”.
Google notes that only users in the United States will see both changes because when “official names vary between countries, Maps users see their official local name.
Everyone in the rest of the world sees both names.
That applies here too.”.

Title: OpenAI's wild week explained: How the Sam Altman story unfolded | CNN Business
# OpenAI's wild week explained: How the Sam Altman story unfolded | CNN Business.
New York/New Delhi CNN — .
In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter , cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week's whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating.
Sam Altman — the leader of one of the world's most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the most visible figure in the fledgling industry — was fired Friday night by the startup's directors in a surprise move.
Less than five days later, he's back as the company's CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision.
The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its first-ever developer conference , where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot.
If you're just catching up, here's what you missed from a week so incredible you'd be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI's ChatGPT.
Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI's board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public.
Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board.
Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board.
The board said Mira Murati, the company's chief technology officer, would become interim CEO.
OpenAI's strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman's ouster just minutes before the board's announcement.
Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he “loved working with such talented people” and that he would have “more to say about what's next later.”.
Brockman promptly quit.
“Please don't spend any time being concerned.
We will be fine,” Brockman said in a Friday post on X. “Greater things coming soon.” .
A key factor in the CEO's firing was tension between Altman, who favored developing AI more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously, according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher, who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events.
Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture.
OpenAI's board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return.
By Sunday afternoon, Altman was back at OpenAI 's headquarters — this time with a guest badge — to negotiate his potential return.
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion.
A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman's demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO.
But those talks broke down.
As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group.
At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon's streaming service, Twitch.
Murati would return to her role as OpenAI's chief technology officer.
In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as “a once-in-a-lifetime” opportunity.
He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman's firing.
But OpenAI employees were not convinced.
More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company's board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman.
They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met.
Altman posted on X, saying, “we have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i'm so excited. one team, one mission.”.
The drama was far from over.
The Verge reported Monday afternoon that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign.
And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was “open to both options” when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft.
“Look, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,” Nadella said.
“We chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.”.
Altman was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI's CEO, the company said on X.
“We have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,” the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce.
Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO Adam D'Angelo.
“We are collaborating to figure out the details,” it said.
In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is “looking forward” to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm's “strong partnership” with Microsoft.
It's unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman's return.
Posting on X, Shear wrote: “I am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work …
I'm glad to have been a part of the solution.”.
Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. .
Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found.
And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI.
“We are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,” Nadella said on X. “We believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.” .

CNN — .
The Blue Ghost lunar lander has captured its first images of the moon from the spacecraft's orbit around Earth, the Texas-based company Firefly Aerospace announced this week.
The two images — which the company posted Monday on the social media platform X — features a view of the moon from the top deck of the 6.6-foot-tall (2-meter-tall) lunar lander as well as a snapshot of the celestial orb on its own.
As the spacecraft continues its journey to the moon, with an expected landing date of March 2, Firefly plans to provide regular mission updates , the company said.
The private US spacecraft has also been capturing images and videos of our planet, including footage of Earth eclipsing the sun , that shows the spacecraft submerged in brief darkness as the Earth blocks nearly all of the sun's light.
On Friday, Firefly released footage that Blue Ghost took of Earth eclipsing the moon as the spacecraft traveled in orbit.
“Firefly's first Moon and Blue Marble images captured by our Blue Ghost lunar lander embodies everything this bold, unstoppable team has worked so hard for over the last three years.
And we're just getting started,” said Will Coogan, Firefly's Blue Ghost chief engineer, in an email.
Blue Ghost has been orbiting Earth since January 15, when the lander hitched a ride on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.
The lunar spacecraft is expected to leave Earth's orbit in about one week, embarking on a four-day journey to the moon.
Blue Ghost will orbit our celestial neighbor for 16 days before attempting a descent to the lunar surface.
“Blue Ghost is a third of its way to the Moon, and we expect to capture even more breathtaking imagery,” Coogan said.
“Most importantly, we'll be capturing critical science data for our NASA customers all along the way that will pave the way for a lasting lunar presence and unlock exploration further into our solar system.”.
The lander carries 10 NASA science and technology instruments aboard as part of the space agency's Commercial Lunar Payload Services, or CLPS, initiative, that will collect and send back data on the moon.
CLPS is part of NASA's broader Artemis program, which aims to land astronauts on the moon for the first time in more than 50 years.
So far, all NASA technology aboard is “healthy” and operating as expected, the NASA Artemis blog announced on Monday .
Firefly CEO Jason Kim previously told CNN that he is excited about sharing images and footage that Blue Ghost captures.
“There's a phenomenon called the lunar horizon glow (scattered light caused by floating electrostatic particles) that only the Apollo 15 and 17 astronauts have seen with their eyes,” Kim said.
“We're going to be able to capture that in 4K-by-4K high-definition video and share that with the rest of the world.” .
The company plans to capture HD imagery of a total lunar eclipse from the moon when Earth will move directly between our neighbor and the sun as it travels along its orbital path.
On Earth, those in the path of totality will see the moon passing completely into Earth's shadow, causing the moon to take on a reddish hue.
It will be visible between March 13-14 for Western Europe, parts of Asia, parts of Australia, western Africa, North and South America, and Antarctica.
If all goes well, Blue Ghost will land on the far eastern edge of the moon's near side by Mons Latreille, an ancient volcanic feature in a more than 300-mile-wide (483-kilometer) basin called Mare Crisium, or “Sea of Crises.”
The lander will then perform surface operations for one lunar day (about 14 Earth days) before it faces lunar nighttime, where the period of darkness and cold temperatures are expected to cause the spacecraft to cease operations.

CNN — .
The biggest tech news this week is the ouster of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry.
Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to resign .
Altman has already moved on to a role at Microsoft.
And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its third CEO in as many days.
It's all very juicy.
But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company's internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions that will determine so much of our technological future?
What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions?
And how should other institutions - governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies - reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators?.
OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence “ to benefit humanity as a whole .”
But that sensibility hasn't lasted.
The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm.
They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public before some employees believed they were ready .
The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it - but they also won't tell reporters or the public exactly what it is.
This dynamic - a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors - is partly to blame for Altman's firing.
The OpenAI board, according to CNN's David Goldman , worried that “the company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.”
At particular issue seemed to be Altman's efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot.
This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried.
But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company's largest shareholder.
Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he'll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants.
And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy - without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives.
AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence.
At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work).
And the ramifications could be much more extreme.
AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability to lie and to cover their tracks .
They have already been able to suggest the design to make a virus spread more quickly.
Many researchers acutely understand just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper's paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and “gas masks from the Israeli Defense Force” in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans, according to reporting in the New Yorker. .
But don't worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, “no gas mask is helping anyone.” (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI's risks - at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils - the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology is worth a read). .
AI is very exciting technology.
But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of “it may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier” but in the sense of “it could break down human societies and kill us all.”.
Given the life-altering potential of AI - that even if it doesn't kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed - we all have a stake in how it's being developed.
And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be largely men ) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe.
And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve - and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit.
Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden?
Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs?.

One thing is clear: AI is coming.
And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century.
It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential - except likely more difficult to regulate and control.
“Regulation” does not begin to scratch the surface of what's needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first.
But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step.
So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition.
But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity - our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety.
The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world.
But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?.

Title: Tariffs guide: How much you'll pay, and when Trump will put them in place | CNN Business
# Tariffs guide: How much you'll pay, and when Trump will put them in place | CNN Business.
CNN — .
President Donald Trump says he will impose his tariffs over the weekend, gambling that taxing American companies for imported goods will ultimately punish the countries that make stuff Americans want — and bring those nations to the negotiating table.
But it's a risky bet that could easily backfire on American consumers and the economy.
In the United States, tariffs typically serve a limited but important purpose: They are intended to grow America's economy by incentivizing the purchase of made-in-the-USA goods.
They accomplish that by effectively penalizing American companies that buy foreign goods with high taxes.
Economists largely believe that, in limited circumstances, tariffs can be effective tools for economic growth.
But Trump believes that tariffs have an altogether different purpose.
Trump has long praised tariffs as effective economic policy.
On Monday, Trump called “tariff” the fourth-most beautiful word in the dictionary, behind “God,”
“love” and “religion.”.
And Trump has repeatedly (and incorrectly) said that “the tariff sheriff,” former President William McKinley, ushered in an era of American prosperity at the end of the 19th century by going all-in on tariffs.
Though the US economy was growing strong in the 1890s, that was largely on the back of practically unrestricted immigration, among other factors.
Still, Trump has used and promised to employ tariffs for three primary purposes: to raise revenue, to bring trade into balance and to bring rival countries to the negotiating table.
America is running massive deficits, and Trump's tax cut plan could put the budget even deeper in the hole.
Trump has said the tariffs will make up for lost revenue: He predicted last week in a keynote address to the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum that the tariffs would bring in hundreds of billions of dollars — perhaps trillions of dollars — into the US Treasury.
Trump routinely criticizes American trade policy for “subsidizing” Canada and Mexico, saying America is “losing” hundreds of billions of dollars to its neighboring nations.
Trump is imprecisely talking about the trade gap , the difference between what America exports and imports.
Some economists caution that Trump's language about America's trade gap presents an unfair representation of what has become a crucial mechanism for the US economy — its ability to purchase services offered by other countries as well as stuff that isn't made here much, like coffee.
And Trump likes tariffs because they can force countries to give up something he believes is in America's best interest.
Although tariffs are charged to importers, they can dissuade buyers from purchasing goods from tariffed countries, hurting those nations' economies.
That has led some of them to seek agreements to avoid tariffs.
Trump has said he wants Canada and Mexico to stop the flow of undocumented immigrants and illegal drugs into the United States.
And for China, Trump has said tariffs would be aimed at forcing the country to make good on what he said was a stated promise to him that the government would execute people caught sending fentanyl to the United States.
Trump and his administration have been consistent: Tariffs in some form are coming on Saturday.
But they've offered conflicting information about what tariffs would be announced this weekend.
During an Oval Office signing ceremony on his first day in office, Trump said he would impose 25% across-the-board tariffs on Mexico and Canada on February 1.
The next day he said he would place a 10% tariff on all goods from China on February 1.
Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reiterated Wednesday that February 1 was when tariffs would go into effect.
And again on Thursday from the Oval Office, Trump said his administration will be announcing 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico Saturday.
Friday, Leavitt rebutted a Reuters report that suggested tariffs could be delayed, stating that 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico and 10% tariffs on China would be put in place Saturday.
But Trump at an address to House Republicans on Monday spelled out specific items that his administration would tariff — rather than across-the-board tariffs — including pharmaceuticals, microchips and steel.
Confusingly, earlier that day, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was pushing for a plan to begin with a 2.5% tariff on all goods and gradually increase them, according to the Financial Times .
But Trump told reporters on Air Force One that he would reject that plan, saying “that would not be acceptable to me,” saying tariffs needed to be “much, much bigger.” .
There's widespread doubt on Wall Street that Trump will rush to put into effect those massive tariffs in full force on Saturday.
To enact tariffs, Trump will probably declare a national economic emergency, invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, known as “IEEPA,” which unilaterally authorizes a president to manage imports during a national emergency, CNN has previously reported .
But Chris Krueger, an analyst at TD Securities, noted that Trump has not yet triggered the IEEPA statute and is running out of time to get that done for Saturday's promised tariffs.
If not Saturday — or if some limited tariffs go in place Saturday — more severe tariffs could be put in place later this year.
Trump's pick for Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, hinted at a second wave of tariffs against Mexico and Canada that could come in the spring — perhaps April.
He suggested that the initial tariffs, coming as soon as Saturday, are “action-oriented” tariffs aimed at reducing fentanyl and illegal immigrants coming over the US border.
And he said those action-oriented tariffs may be avoided altogether: “As far as I know, they are acting swiftly, and if they execute it, there will be no tariff,” Lutnick said Wednesday at his confirmation hearing.
“And if they don't, then there will be.”.
Canada has been hoping to avoid tariffs by doing just that, working with the United States and pledging Wednesday to stand up a “strike force”on fentanyl to hit drug traffickers “harder and faster,” deploying two Black Hawk helicopters, 60 drones and new specially trained canine teams at the border.
Canada's foreign affairs minister Mélanie Joly said Wednesday she was hopeful to avoid tariffs after her meeting with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, but she acknowledged that no one knows what will happen February 1 — only the president, she said.
But Canada is also preparing to retaliate against tariffs, if necessary.
Canadian officials are working on a list of dozens of American products that the United States exports to Canada, targeting items that both send a political message and inflict a reasonable amount of economic damage, two sources said, including ceramic products, steel products, furniture, certain alcoholic beverages like Bourbon and Jack Daniels whiskey, orange juice and pet food, among other goods.
The second kind of tariff, which Lutnick said would be “ordinary tariffs,” could be executed after a study on the macroeconomic effects of levying import taxes on America's neighbors.
That study will be concluded by April, as mandated by an executive order Trump signed on his first day in office, Lutnick said.
Trump has also proposed 10% tariffs on all other goods coming into America, though he said last week his administration wasn't ready to implement those just yet.
And he proposed tariffs on Denmark to incentivize it to give control of Greenland to the United States. (He has also threatened to use military force to take Greenland.) Trump on Thursday said that goods from BRICS nations — a coalition of emerging economies backed by China and Russia — would face 100% tariffs if they attempted to move away from the US dollar in international trade.
Importantly, Trump has a history of threatening tariffs, only to later rescind them.
Last week, for example, he announced steep tariffs on Colombia in retaliation for failing to accept US miliary planes with deportees.
Ten hours later, he said the tariffs would not go in place after Colombia reversed its stance.
In 2019, Trump threatened a 5% tariff on all Mexican imports that would rise to 25% if Mexico declined to take action to reduce the number of undocumented immigrants crossing the border with the United States.
But after Mexican officials traveled to Washington for a week of in-person negotiations — and an agreement was reached to reinstate the “Remain in Mexico” immigration policy — the tariffs were never implemented.
If Trump follows through with limited tariffs, he has said they'd be focused on pharmaceuticals, steel and computer chips.
Trump on Thursday said oil might not be part of any tariffs on Mexico and Canada, and his administration would make that determination as early as Thursday night.
But if tariffs are broader, that could raise prices on many common purchases, because Mexico, China and Canada are America's top trading partners.
Some prices could rise quite quickly.
For example, because most American cars are partially made in Mexico and Canada, the tariffs would add a minimum of thousands of dollars to the cost of cars, according to experts.
Gas, food and alcohol prices would also rise if Trump imposed Canadian and Mexican tariffs.
Sneaker prices would rise if Trump raised tariffs on China: About 99% of shoes sold in the United States are imported, mostly from China, according to the Footwear Distributors & Retailers of America, a trade group that represents Nike, Steve Madden, Cole Haan and other footwear brands.
America also gets the vast majority of its electronics from there.
Tariffs in certain circumstances do not cause inflation problems.
Trump's first-term tariffs did not meaningfully raise inflation, although they were far narrower in scope than what Trump is currently proposing, and the pandemic that follow skewed some of the inflationary aspects of the tariffs — many of which remained in place during the Biden administration.
But mainstream economists largely agree that tariffs cause inflation.
That's because importers — not the countries exporting the goods — pay the tax, and they typically pass that cost on to consumers in the form of higher prices.
New research from the Peterson Institute for International Economics suggests Trump's aggressive tariff campaign will force American consumers to pay more for practically everything — from foreign-made sneakers and toys to food.
They also can lead to trade wars.
China, Europe and Canada, for example, retaliated against America with their own tariffs on particular items after the first Trump administration levied tariffs on certain items from those nations.
Trump's proposed tariffs could add $272 billion a year to tax burdens, according to Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Corpay Cross-Border Solutions.
The Peterson Institute has estimated Trump's proposed tariffs would cost the typical US household over $2,600 a year. .
Still, some proponents of Trump's plan say the risk is worth the reward.
Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, last week told CNBC that if tariffs cause a little inflation but address a national security issue, then people should “get over it.” .
Lutnick echoed those remarks Wednesday.
“If Canada is going to rely on America for its economic growth, how about you treat our farmers, our ranchers and our fishermen with respect?” he said.
“And so I think the president and our Trump administration is focused on improving the lives of our producers.”.
In the end, Lutnick argued tariffs mean “the economy of the United States will be much, much better.”.

Title: Trump Media grants large amounts of stock to directors, including two who are Trump administration nominees | CNN Business
# Trump Media grants large amounts of stock to directors, including two who are Trump administration nominees | CNN Business.
New York CNN — .
Trump Media & Technology Group this week gave its directors blocks of shares currently worth just over $825,000 - including to Kash Patel and Linda McMahon , two of President Donald Trump's key nominees to serve in his administration.
As part of a stock grant to members of its board, the Truth Social owner on Tuesday issued nearly 26,000 shares each to its six directors: Patel, McMahon, former US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, Eric Swider, Kyle Green and Donald Trump Jr, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission disclosed Thursday.
Patel has been tapped for FBI director and McMahon for Department of Education secretary; both are awaiting formal confirmation.
Many critics of President Trump say that his complex web of financial stakes in various properties, cryptocurrencies and his social media company could allow him to profit off his presidency and improperly curry favor with business partners who also serve his government.
Trump has taken at least one step to avoid a conflict of interest: He announced in December that he transferred his dominant stake in Trump Media to a revocable trust of which the president's eldest son is the sole beneficiary and Trump Jr. is the sole trustee, according to regulatory filings.
He does not vote on company or board decisions.
It's common for company board members to be awarded shares, and there is no evidence whatsoever that these grants were anything other than typical stock awards to board members.
However, the financial relationships that potential high-profile Trump government leaders have with Trump Media - a company built on the president's brand and a business in which the president is the effectively dominant shareholder - could add to conflict of interest concerns that have already surrounded the company and the second Trump administration.
The filings state that they received the shares “as consideration for services provided” starting when the company went public in March 2024.
The shares issued are restricted stock units, where 25% of the total shares they receive — about 6,500 shares each worth over $200,000 at Friday's closing levels — could be immediately sold.
The remaining 75% of shares are set to vest in quarterly installments between March 2025 and March 2027.
Disclosure of the gifts came the same day that Patel was grilled in a combative Senate confirmation hearing , including about his past comments praising the rioters who attacked the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.
The company also announced this week plans to expand into financial services and potentially buy bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
Trump Media said it plans to launch a fintech brand called Truth.
Fi and to introduce investment vehicles that will focus on American growth, manufacturing, energy and the “Patriot Economy.” .

Title: Louvre museum in dire state, problems 'endanger' art, director warns in plea for help | CNN
# Louvre museum in dire state, problems 'endanger' art, director warns in plea for help | CNN.
Paris Reuters — .
The Louvre, the world's most-visited museum and home to Leonardo da Vinci's “ Mona Lisa ,” has requested urgent help from the French government to restore and renovate its ageing exhibition halls and better protect its countless works of art.
In a letter to Culture Minister Rachida Dati, revealed by Paris daily Le Parisien and confirmed to Reuters by the Louvre, Louvre President Laurence des Cars warned that the centuries-old building is in a dire state, and pointed at problems with water leaks and “worrying temperature swings which endanger the conservation of works of art.”.
Built in Paris in the late 12th century, the Louvre Palace for centuries was the official residence of the kings of France, until Louis XIV—weary of rebellious crowds in Paris— abandoned it for Versailles, after which it became a museum for the royal art collection in 1793.
Last year, the Louvre welcomed 8.7 million visitors, who all entered via the pyramid-shaped western entrance, designed by architect I.M. Pei, which itself has become problematic as its greenhouse effect makes the Louvre's subterranean reception uncomfortably hot on summer days.
A visit to the Louvre, the museum's head wrote, has become “a physical ordeal,” with artworks being hard to find due to inadequate signage, lack of space for visitors to take a break, and insufficient food and sanitary facilities.
Designed to receive four million visitors a year, the Louvre saw record attendance of 10.2 million visitors in 2018, but des Cars—who was appointed in 2021—has imposed a limit of 30,000 visitors per day in order to avoid overcrowding.
Des Cars' letter did not mention financing, but French TV news channel BFM said renovation costs could amount to €500 million ($525 million), which would be a challenge for President Emmanuel Macron's government, which has struggled to gets its 2025 budget approved by parliament.
Le Parisien reported that talks are underway between Macron's office, the culture ministry and the Louvre.
A source close to Macron's office confirmed that “the president has followed this issue with attention for several months.”.
The culture ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
After his first election in 2017, Macron gave his victory speech in front of the Louvre, while the Tuileries gardens around the former palace also played a prominent role during the 2024 Paris Olympics .
Besides a top-to-bottom renovation, the museum is also considering building a new wing for the “Mona Lisa,” as well as a new entrance on the eastern end of the museum, to relieve congestion at the Pyramid entrance.

Sixty-seven people are presumed dead after a passenger plane, on approach to Reagan National Airport near Washington, DC, collided Wednesday night with a US Army helicopter midair , sending both aircraft into the Potomac River below, officials said.
There were 64 people on board the plane and three soldiers in the Army helicopter, according to DC Mayor Muriel Bowser.
First responders were battling cold and windy conditions Thursday as they worked to recover bodies from the Potomac in near-freezing temperatures.
“This was a dark and excruciating night in our nation's capital and in our nation's history, and a tragedy of terrible proportions,” President Donald Trump said in a news conference Thursday.
“As one nation, we grieve for every precious soul that has been taken from us so suddenly.”.
The passenger plane was American Airlines Flight 5342, operated by PSA Airlines, traveling from Wichita, Kansas, to Reagan National, the Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement.
The Bombardier CRJ700 regional jet was due to land at the airport Wednesday night when it collided midair with the US Army helicopter as it approached Runway 33, according to the FAA and defense officials.
The US Army Black Hawk helicopter was conducting a routine training for pilots who take part in “continuity of government” missions, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Thursday.
The crash is the deadliest aviation disaster in the United States since November 12, 2001, when an American Airlines flight crashed in New York, killing all 260 people on board.

Title: Where London residents are living to avoid 'insane' rents | CNN Business
# Where London residents are living to avoid 'insane' rents | CNN Business.
London CNN — .
Opposite a bed in central London, light filters through a stained-glass window depicting , in fragments of copper and blue, Jesus Christ.
Three people have lived in the deserted cathedral in the past two years, with each occupant — an electrician, a sound engineer and a journalist — paying a monthly fee to live in the priest's quarters.
The cathedral is managed by Live-in Guardians, a company finding occupants for disused properties, including schools, libraries and pubs, across Britain.
The residents — so-called property guardians — pay a fixed monthly “license fee,” which is usually much lower than the typical rent in the same area.
Applications to become guardians are going “through the roof,” with more people in their late thirties and forties signing on than in the past, said Arthur Duke, the founder and managing director of Live-in Guardians.
“That's been brought about by the cost-of-living crisis,” he said.
“People are looking for cheaper ways to live.”.
The practice of populating disused properties with guardians is unregulated in Britain and comes with fewer legal protections for the residents than renting.
Guardians have also complained of inconveniences and outright hazards, such as no access to drinkable tap water and rickety ceilings.
Still, demand for guardianships is rocketing as rents and property prices remain unaffordable for scores of people in many parts of the country.
Luke Williams has saved “thousands and thousands of pounds on rent” as a guardian over the past six years.
The 45-year-old currently lives in a former office block in east London.
It's a huge, open-plan space still dotted with whiteboards and hand sanitizer dispensers.
Williams said his job a project manager for a tech company pays well, yet “insane” rental costs in the British capital are keeping him in guardianships as much as his penchant for the unusual.
“As well as making financial sense, I like the lifestyle, and I like the interesting, quirky places,” he said.
Guardians often live in spacious buildings, in prime locations, which are due for demolition or redevelopment and whose owners want to deter squatters without paying for a round-the-clock security team.
The practice started in the Netherlands in the 1980s and has long attracted artists, musicians and other creatives in search of enough square footage to do their work, as well as those prepared to live more precariously.
For example, in Britain, guardians can be asked to vacate the property with 28 days' notice, compared with the two months afforded to most private renters.
More than 13,500 people live as guardians in Britain, according to an estimate by the Property Guardian Providers Association, compared with the 11 million renting their home through a private landlord.
Graham Sievers, chair of the PGPA — which represents three large guardianship providers, companies that connect property owners with guardians and manage the buildings — said demand is “the highest it's ever been” since the practice arrived in the country about 20 years ago.
About 50,000 people applied to become guardians via those three companies last year, a rise of more than two-thirds compared with 2022, the previous time the PGPA surveyed its members.
Although guardianships have traditionally attracted people in their twenties, increasing numbers of thirty-somethings are signing up, said Sievers.
In London, much like in New York, rents have shot up in recent years as people have flocked back to big cities after the pandemic.
The average private rent in the British capital jumped 11.5% last year, to £2,220 ($2,764) a month, according to provisional government figures.
And data from SpareRoom, a popular roommate search site, shows that the average monthly rent for a room in shared accommodation in London stood at £993 ($1,212) during the last three months of 2024.
According to Ben Twomey, chief executive of Generation Rent, a non-profit campaigning for renters' rights, the typical rent in London meets the government's definition of “unaffordable,” eating up more than 30% of a renters' pre-tax income.
For some, then, guardianships have offered a lifeline.
“There's a new type of person who is probably almost forced into (guardianship),” said Louis Goss, a 29-year-old journalist and former guardian.
“Basically, that's the only thing that's affordable to them.”.
Goss said that what began as a “bohemian lifestyle choice” looks increasingly like a symptom of Britain's housing crisis.
The government estimates that 300,000 homes need to be built each year in England alone, but housebuilding is failing to keep up with demand.
Goss has done four separate stints as a guardian in London, in an empty police station, a nursing home for the elderly, a student residence hall and, finally, a town hall.
In 2019, in the police station located in the capital's upmarket Chelsea neighborhood, Goss lived with around 50 other guardians, most of whom had recently left college and were searching for cheap housing and new friendships.
Each month, he paid a license fee of £500 ($610) — which covered bills — roughly half of what he estimates he would've paid as a private tenant in the same area.
He remembers hosting parties in the basement and its adjoining holding cells, and climbing up a fire escape to access the kitchen.
The joyful chaos and camaraderie felt like being on a “pirate ship,” he said.
“The feeling was very much like people had chosen to be there.”.
But, by 2021, the mood had shifted.
In the student residence hall, Goss said he encountered more people in their thirties looking to save money as rents rose.
Some moved into the building's basement, which a group of elderly Catholic nuns had occupied until the pandemic forced them to make a hasty exit, leaving behind crucifixes and religious robes.
Last year, Goss decided to walk away from guardianships and rent privately.
“I had just got tired of the conditions,” he said of his final building, which came without drinkable tap water.
He had noticed, too, shrinking discounts on many license fees compared with rents.
The benefits of guardianship simply no longer justified the drawbacks.
Tim Lowe, founder and director of The Lowe Group, a guardianship provider, has hiked license fees in recent years as the costs of running properties, including energy bills, have skyrocketed.
The fees are still lower than comparable rents, he noted, but the gap is smaller than in the past.
Lowe is adamant guardianships should be a “platform” to help people make friends or save money to buy a home, not the last resort for the vulnerable, such as those who could qualify for government-subsidized housing.
“It's not a life raft,” he said.
The UK housing ministry states in its guidance on guardianships that it “does not endorse or encourage” the practice because people “can be asked to live in conditions that do not meet the standards of residential properties.” .
Charley Hullah, a long-time guardian, can concur.
The 31-year-old musician has been a guardian in six properties since 2013.
He left one after the kitchen and bathroom ceilings caved in and recalls feeling nervous every time he took a shower, which had been installed under a mass of electrical wires in an old toilet for disabled people.
Twice he smelt burning.
He believes that providers often have “no incentive to do things in the proper way” because the buildings are set to be demolished anyway.
The PGPA has stepped in to supervise providers, setting standards on fire safety, for example, and conducting random inspections of buildings. .
“The property guardian model should work, and it should work well,” said Sievers at the PGPA, noting that he has asked the government to establish an agency to regulate the industry.
He believes vast amounts of office space still lying vacant after the pandemic could be repurposed for guardianships to help ease Britain's housing shortage.
For now, scores of Londoners are trapped in a vicious circle.
Costly rents mean they are struggling to save the money needed for a down payment to buy a home, which in turn keeps them stuck in rented housing.
Twomey at Generation Rent said renters in Britain have a particular incentive to buy as they generally enjoy fewer legal protections than their counterparts in Europe, such as guardrails against eviction and excessive rent hikes.
But, according to a 2023 analysis by the non-profit, it would take close to 20 years for a single person on an average income, renting in shared accommodation in London, to save enough for a down payment on a property in the city.
The average price of a house or apartment in London stood at more than half a million pounds in November ($635,000), according to the latest government data.
“We're basically losing so much of our potential to save to our landlords,” said Twomey.
“It's just impossible to pull together that money.”.
For some, guardianships have eased that challenge.
Mavis Alaneme and her husband bought a two-bedroom apartment in a county southeast of London in 2023 after almost a decade bouncing between guardianships and rented accommodation.
The 40-year-old business analyst estimates she saved more than £16,000 ($19,700) in unspent rent during that time thanks to being a guardian, adding that her most recent guardianship helped her save for the down payment on her current place.
By the end, she was weary.
Guardianship properties were often run down, the inspections by providers felt intrusive and license fees were rising.
Alaneme has bought peace of mind with her apartment.
“You just can't match it,” she said.
“To actually be here and just sit on our sofa and be like 'no one's going to kick us out' unless you don't pay the mortgage…
This is ours.
We're settled.
And it's lovely.
It's a really lovely feeling.”.
But, for others, guardianships did not turn into that much hoped-for springboard.
“I never thought I'd be doing this for this long,” said Hullah, who lives in a disused apartment block in north London.
“I thought I might be able to move up some kind of ladder into private rented (housing), but I still can't afford it.
So, I just essentially got stuck.”.

# The Chiefs are on course to win a historic Super Bowl three-peat.
This NBA legend could benefit after trademarking the term | CNN.
CNN — .
The Kansas City Chiefs have an opportunity to etch their names into the annals of NFL history at Super Bowl LIX if they are able to win their third title in a row.
Victory over the Philadelphia Eagles in New Orleans on February 9 would make the Chiefs the first team to win three successive Super Bowl rings, cementing the golden era of the franchise.
Winning three championships in a row is colloquially known as a “three-peat,” and if Kansas City decides to use that term to celebrate the moment, an NBA legend could earn quite a significant pay day.
Pat Riley - the former Los Angeles Lakers, New York Knicks and Miami Heat head coach - has several trademarks involving the term “three-peat,” according to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) website .
The nine-time NBA champion's business, Riles & Company, Inc., holds trademarks on the phrases “three-peat,”
“3 peat” and “threepeat,” among others.
The 79-year-old, who is currently the president of the Heat, came up with the idea during his time as Lakers head coach in the 1980s, shortly after the team won their second title in as many years, per ESPN .
Although the Showtime Lakers failed to complete the three-peat, Riley's trademarks were in place for when the Michael Jordan-led Chicago Bulls won their third title in a row in 1993.
The origin of the phrase has been disputed, with the common story that Lakers guard Byron Scott used the term “twee-peat,” which Riley tweaked.
However, Scott's teammate, Wes Matthews, said that he was behind it.
“I just thought of it as a catchy slogan,” Matthews told ESPN in 2014.
“I give Pat a ton of credit for having the vision to do what he did.
I bet he made out real well when the Bulls did it.” .
Owners of trademarks - which protect things like brand names, logos and slogans that identify sources of goods - can claim infringement if other branding would cause consumer confusion.
Remedies range from monetary damages to blocking use.
It means that, should the Chiefs win and decide to use the phrase when celebrating, Riley could be set to benefit financially.
Trademarking the term is like “going out there and picking up a penny on the ground,” Riley told ESPN in 2005.
“It's sort of been an interesting phenomenon.
I found out that if I were ever an entrepreneurial man, I could have made some (money) in my life.”.
The legendary coach and executive added: “I don't pay any attention to it.
If somebody wants to license that phrase, we'll license it to them.
But I don't go out and pursue it.
We don't sell it; we don't browbeat anybody.
If they want it, they go to somebody and they'll pay us a royalty on it.”.

# How your social media consumption can influence your eating habits, according to experts | CNN.
Professional medical help and medication are often a vital part of the eating disorder recovery process.

CNN — .
If your teen is playing with a new phone or smart device after the holidays, you may have some concerns.
But are you paying close enough attention to how more screen time might affect a child's risk for an eating disorder?.
Research has suggested a link between the use of screen time and social media and the risk of developing an eating disorder.
A September study showed that each additional hour of screen time and social media use was associated with higher odds of showing eating disorder symptoms.
And adolescents who spend more time online are more likely to experience cyberbullying, another risk factor for an eating disorder, according to a 2023 study .
Binge-watching and binge-scrolling may also influence binge eating, said Dr. Jason Nagata, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco.
His 2021 study found that every additional hour of social media use was linked with a 62% higher risk of developing binge eating disorder a year later.
The connection between eating disorder risk and social media use is multifaceted, and the way to protect yourself and the kids in your life may take different forms, experts said.
Why might there be such a strong connection between social media and eating disorders?
There are many factors, including comparisons, exposures to unattainable body ideals and intensification of impulsive behaviors, Nagata said.
“With social media, one of the things we know is it gives greater and more immediate access to teens around different ideas.
This is both good and bad,” said Erin Birely, a licensed professional counselor and alumni services coordinator for the Renfrew Center, an eating disorder treatment center with several locations on the East Coast.
Social media makes it easy to join communities, but some may include people who don't have healthy ideas about food and body image, Birely added.
They can share dangerous behavior, which can influence what you start to see as normal.
“Social media can definitely increase the frequency that kids are looking at images that have been edited or posed a certain way, that continue to perpetuate this kind of thin ideal or body image ideals that aren't super helpful,” she said.
Outside of potentially harmful images being advanced, many influencers get paid to promote products that encourage weight loss, said Jennifer Rollin, founder of the Eating Disorder Center in Rockville, Maryland.
There's an awareness that advertisements in magazines can make people feel bad about their appearance so they will buy a product in hopes of making a change, but such tactics are harder to recognize on social media, she added.
The problem isn't just what teens see but also their understanding that others can see them -- whether they are getting bullied or complimented, Nagata said.
“This feedback may lead to a vicious cycle and additional pressures to portray a certain branding,” he said.
“Teens may spend a lot of time thinking or planning for social media postings, which can lead to anxiety and stress.”.
Some of the problematic content is obvious — exercises to “snatch” your waist or dieting advice — but because of how normalized diet culture has become, some of the most impactful content might go completely under your radar, Rollin said.
“The most dangerous thing is really the normalization of behaviors that are incredibly disordered … normalizing this focus on weight loss and body image obsession,” she added.
Even a social media feed with people who aren't trying to get others to lose weight but that features one body type can be unhelpful when it comes to preventing eating disorders, Rollin said.
If you or your teen have feeds that don't show a diversity of body types or a variety of content that may have nothing to do with image (such as hobbies, travel or experiences), it can be easy to get too fixated on bodies, she added.
In fact, adding accounts with a diversity of bodies and experiences to a social media feed can be protective against eating disorders, Rollin said.
Social media isn't the sole cause of eating disorders, and banning it isn't always necessary, Birely said.
For teens, delaying access as long as possible may help, and it is important to be aware of how individuals use it and how they feel when they do so to decide if it is better to take a break, unfollow certain accounts or delete apps altogether, Rollin said.
But there are supportive networks and other benefits on social media as well, Birely added.
“Sometimes it can be a good way to actually help (teens) learn how to tolerate and manage those risks,” she said.
“How do we tolerate the emotions that come up when we see (triggering content)?”.
However much a family limits social media, it is important to keep conversations open between adults, teens or younger kids about what they see on social media and how it might make them feel, Nagata said.
Try to avoid screen time around meals to encourage conversation and keep an eye on children's eating habits.
“Warning signs for eating disorders include when an individual becomes preoccupied or obsessed with weight, appearance, body size, food or exercise in a way that worsens their quality of life and daily functioning,” Nagata said.
“They may withdraw from usual activities or friends because of concerns with body size and appearance.”.
A person's appearance alone cannot necessarily indicate an eating disorder, and people of all genders, races, ethnicities, sexual orientations, ages and sizes can be affected, he added.
If you think that you or your teen may be struggling with an eating disorder or unhealthy anxieties around food, you should seek professional help from a health care provider or therapist, Nagata said.
“Eating disorders are best supported by an interdisciplinary team including a mental health, medical and nutrition provider,” he added.

This eight-part guide will have you packing your bags in no time. .
CNN — .
Of the many depopulated Italian towns to launch bargain home schemes in recent years, none have been more successful than Sicily's Sambuca di Sicilia.
Sambuca's home sell-offs have seen huge demand, with American buyers rushing to snap up discounted houses in the hillside town for a symbolic €1 in 2019 and €2 in 2021 .
Previously largely unknown, even to some Italians, Sambuca has since welcomed so many Americans that it's been nicknamed “Italy's Little America.”.
But according to the town's mayor Giuseppe Cacioppo, this US buyer trend has changed or, at the very least, slowed down.
Now it's Italians who are snapping up the town's abandoned homes.
“Something weird happened with this third batch of auctioned homes; we thought more Americans would apply, so we were amazed that for the first time ever it was mainly Italians from all over Italy,” Cacioppo tells CNN.
Sambuca has placed dozens of dwellings on the market over the years in a bid to revive the community, which has suffered from depopulation as residents move to bigger cities.
In both past editions, the number of requests, mostly from the US, to purchase neglected homes was so high that local authorities had to place the old abandoned properties at auction.
While some bidders opted to snap up abandoned ruins, over a hundred Americans purchased ready-to-occupy homes from locals, revitalizing the area's dwindling real estate market.
So when the town auctioned a new batch of dilapidated homes for a symbolic €3 in November, Cacioppo expected to be flooded by hundreds of bids from US buyers once again.
But he was in for a surprise.
Only 15 bidders took part in the auction this time, and just six of these were successful, offering between €500 (about $513) and €12,500 ($12,837)..
And for the first time ever, Italians were the largest chunk of bidders who succeeded in buying one of the houses.
Aside from one American buyer, the rest were from other European countries, including three Italians.
Cacioppo downplays the lower number of US bidders, arguing that Americans are still flocking to the town to search for houses, but at market value.
“Americans kickstarted the resurrection of Sambuca,” he says.
“They bought 18 crumbly homes at auction in the first two rounds, and over 100 turn-key properties privately.
“Now they're upping the game, seeking homes that may cost more but don't need a restyle, and are often also furbished.”.
Sambuca made global headlines back in 2019, when CNN broke the news of the first round of one-euro homes up for sale, triggering a property stampede made up of mainly American buyers.
Mayor Cacioppo believes that it's thanks to the interest from US buyers that Italians have finally realized what a good deal the bargain homes can be, and are starting to participate too.
“The Italian buyers are all young and this too is a major surprise.
They're not pensioners but people who can also work remotely,” says the mayor.
“They have come to finally appreciate the beauty and attractiveness of Sicily, with all its plus points.”.
Financial adviser Paolo Morabito, 25, from Messina in northeast Sicily, and his architect friend Bruno Surfaro, 28, from Southern Italy's Calabria region, are among them.
The pair, who bid their lucky numbers — €2,222 (around $2,281) — are now the owners of a tiny, 35-square-meter stone dwelling with a panoramic terrace.
They plan to spend some €30,000 (about $30,810) transforming the property into a vacation retreat and rental.
The rules of the scheme stipulate that buyers must have completed the renovation work on their homes within three years, or risk losing their deposit guarantee.
Morabito, who is a fan of old towns, says he had never been to Sambuca until learning of its recent popularity.
“Even though I'm Sicilian and I live just a few kilometers away, I felt embarrassed at never having even visited the place,” he says.
“So when I did, I thought, 'Why leave such opportunities to foreigners?'
We Italians, often too lazy, must wake up and buy these properties as well.
“We've been blind so far to places like Sambuca, full of derelict empty homes.
We have these towns all in our backyard.”.
Cristian Salucci, 47, an Italian bidder from the northern city of Ravenna in the Emilia-Romagna region, spent €1,000 (around $1,027) on a 70-square-meter house, which he plans to spend some €100,000 ($102,700) restyling.
“I saw an opportunity for investment, and a close retreat for family vacations with my wife and son,” he says.
According to Salucci, his job as a construction projects manager across Italy helped him realize that Sambuca's housing scheme has a lot to offer in terms of revitalization of rural towns.
“I don't think Italians realize the potentials of buying and giving a new life to one-euro homes.”.
Paul Kanitra, a 45-year-old civil servant from New Jersey, was the only US buyer in the third auction.
Kanitra's great-great-grandparents emigrated from Sambuca di Sicilia in the late 1800s for New Jersey in search of a brighter future, leaving behind their family home in the town's old district.
He bought a badly damaged property in an attempt to reconnect with his Italian roots and now faces a tough renovation.
“The three-euro program has given my wife and I the opportunity to now go back in time and re-establish a little presence in the town of my ancestors,” says Kanitra, who prefers not to disclose how much he bid for the house.
“All of my relatives will share in the small project and are incredibly excited.”.
Although the roof at the front of the property is partially caved in, the quarry for Sambuca stone is just outside the town and construction costs are very low, says Kanitra, who was surprised to learn that he was the only US buyer this time around.
Once the renovation work on the home is complete, Kanitra plans to use it partly as a private vacation retreat for he and and his wife, and partly as a non-profit center to foster migrant ties between New Jersey and Sicily.
“It's our way of giving back to both sides of the ocean,” says Kanitra.

CNN — .
Breaking up is hard.
Breaking up with someone around Valentine's Day — a holiday all about love — can seem downright mean.
Or is it?.
February is often celebrated as the month of love, yet many couples tend to split around Valentine's Day, said Kiana Shelton, a therapist at Mindpath Health in Texas.
Valentine's Day, with its chocolates and roses and romantic dinners, can add a lot of social pressure to show how much you love your partner.
Those gestures can feel disingenuous for someone ready to call it quits.
It's also a time when some people are still reflecting on their New Year's resolutions for self-improvement, which can include a current relationship.
So, is it better to break up before Valentine's Day or buy the flowers and wait for some time until after the holiday has passed?
Relationship experts weigh in on when it's best to break up: before the holiday or afterward.
Breaking up is usually not a spontaneous decision but rather something people consider for a long time, said Dr. Morgan Cope, an assistant professor of psychology at Centre College in Kentucky, who conducts research on the intersection of the self and romantic relationships.
While dumping your partner before the holiday appears heartless, she said there will never be a good time to end the relationship except now.
There will always be another holiday, birthday and other excuses to prolong a relationship that has run its course.
Spending Valentine's Day with someone you do not have romantic feelings for can also be mentally distressing.
“Imagine picking out a gift or going out to dinner when you don't want to be there, being physically intimate with your partner you don't want to be with,” Cope said.
“Breakups are always going to be difficult, but you don't have to make it any harder on yourself or your partner by forcing something that isn't meant to be.”.
Social media also has made Valentine's Day a performative spectacle, creating a “breeding ground for comparison and false perceptions about what it means to show up for the people we love,” Shelton said.
There is immense pressure for public displays of affection, such as buying jewelry or wrapping a bouquet of roses with money, to compete with what others are posting about their partner, she noted.
Expectations for luxury gifts and expensive dinners may have people reevaluating whether it's worth spending time and money on a new relationship or one that is not going anywhere.
By breaking up before Valentine's Day, Cope said people are free from planning a romantic evening that feels forced and insincere.
“You want to be truthful and authentic to your partner, which means not investing emotional and financial resources into a big celebration,” Cope said.
She argued that breaking up might surprise your partner because celebrating the holiday may make people believe the relationship is more secure than it is, leading to confusion and possible resentment.
Cope advised giving yourself at least a week before the holiday to end the relationship.
While it will still be a tough conversation, it gives each person time to process the breakup and make alternative plans for Valentine's Day with friends and family.
Now if you're still on the fence about ending the relationship, Shelton advised waiting until after the holidays.
Without the holiday fanfare, she said people have a clearer mindset to process their emotions, including whether the pressure of making a grand declaration of love was what left them uncertain about the relationship's future.
Waiting until after the holiday also can give people one last chance to show that the relationship is worth continuing.
Shelton said that seeing a partner go above and beyond on Valentine's Day may address doubts and make people more willing to work through their issues rather than end the relationship.
Lastly, some people might break up after Valentine's Day to avoid creating a mental association between the holiday and a breakup.
Shelton explained that our brains tend to create patterns and find meaning between two events.
An annual reminder of the breakup can make it seem like your relationships never makes it beyond Valentine's Day.
“Breaking up not so close to the holiday will avoid making this false association,” she said.
Guilt is a normal and common feeling when breaking up with someone.
“Guilt is a social emotion we feel when we're around other people or thinking about what other people think of us,” Cope said.
While the moment hurts right now, she advised reminding yourself that you are considerate enough not to waste your partner's time by misleading them with holiday celebrations, which can imply that the relationship is strong.
Shelton said one of the ways to move through discomfort is to acknowledge the timing.
“An example is saying that I know it's close to Valentine's Day, but that it's important to express what I am feeling without being pressured to perform around this day,” she said.
Being direct yet compassionate will evoke many emotions but using “I” statements to express feelings without playing the blame game will better explain the reason behind this difficult decision.
Ending with kindness can make any difficult situation more bearable.
Shelton said it helps to express gratitude for the time shared when the relationship was meaningful.
“If we're focusing on the discomfort from breaking up, we'll continue to feel shame and guilt,” she said.
“Focusing on the growth and lessons learned will help each other move forward in future relationships.”.

Title: Stock futures slide after Trump imposes tariffs | CNN Business
# Stock futures slide after Trump imposes tariffs | CNN Business.
CNN — .
US stock market futures plunged Sunday, one day after President Donald Trump announced 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico and 10% tariffs on China set to go into effect on Tuesday.
Dow futures were down 1.4%, or over 600 points, while S&P 500 futures dropped 1.9%.
The futures traded for tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite were down 2.4% as of 6:36 p.m. ET.
Bitcoin was also down 3.5% over the last 24 hours.
The sharp selloff in the futures market implies the indexes will also open substantially lower when trading kicks off Monday at 9:30 a.m. ET.
Hours after the Trump administration announced the tariffs, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said her country will impose retaliatory tariffs, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced “far-reaching” retaliatory levies.
China's commerce ministry said it will file a complaint with the World Trade Organization and “take corresponding countermeasures,” without elaborating.
“This will include immediate tariffs on $30 billion worth of goods as of Tuesday, followed by further tariffs on $125 billion of American products in 21 days' time, to allow Canadian companies and supply chains to seek to find alternatives,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Saturday.
More than 1,200 goods will be impacted by Canada's immediate tariffs, according to senior government officials on Sunday.
The imposed tariffs would be harmful for states such as Florida, which exports orange juice, fruits and vegetables to Canada, officials said.
Both the Mexican peso and the Canadian dollar weakened relative to the US dollar in the 24 hours since Trump announced the new tariffs, while the Chinese yuan hit a new low.
Economists warned that American families may bear the burden of these tariffs — and Trump posted to his Truth Social account that Americans could face “some pain.”
The tariffs will make groceries more expensive because Mexico and Canada are the main sources of America's imported agricultural goods .
Gas, steel and cars are among other goods expected to be more expensive for American consumers.

Title: Netanyahu blows past ceasefire talks deadline to confer with Trump | CNN
# Netanyahu blows past ceasefire talks deadline to confer with Trump | CNN.
Jerusalem CNN — .
A deadline to begin talks on extending Gaza's ceasefire arrived Monday with the Israeli prime minister in Washington, silence from his office about when a negotiating team might engage with Hamas, and considerable uncertainty about what the next stage of the fragile truce will look like.
The ceasefire, in place for just over two weeks, is set to expire on March 1.
Under the terms of the deal, talks on the next phase are supposed to begin no later than Monday.
But the Israeli government has yet to publicly unveil a negotiating team for the talks, let alone send them to Qatar or Egypt, where Hamas is sending a delegation this week.
Hamas has not publicly commented on Monday's deadline.
Qatar's prime minister, who has acted as an intermediary in the talks, said Sunday that there were “no clear details” on when or how the talks would start.
“We hope to see some movement in the coming days,” Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani said during a press conference in Doha.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has made clear that he sees the path forward not in Doha or Cairo, but in Washington, where he will this week become the first foreign leader to hold a formal meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Netanyahu's office said on the eve of his departure that he had agreed with Trump's Middle East envoy that “negotiations on the second phase of the hostage deal will begin with their meeting in Washington,” during which “they will discuss Israel's positions.”.
Since the ceasefire went into effect on January 19, Hamas and its allies have released 18 hostages held in Gaza.
In exchange, the Israeli government has released 583 Palestinians held in detention - some serving life sentences for serious offenses - but also a significant number of children held without public charge or trial.
The ceasefire has seen the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gazan population centers, a surge of aid entering the enclave and, for the first time since May last year, the opening of the vital Rafah crossing on the border with Egypt for the evacuation of injured and sick Palestinians.
It has also largely held apart from a few violations - only the second respite in 15 months of war, after a brief truce in November 2023.
But the first phase of the truce was only ever meant to last 42 days.
Talks for the second phase must begin Monday, the 16th day of the truce, meaning that Netanyahu is breaching the terms of the deal by talking to Trump first.
Over that second period, CNN understands that the Israeli military would fully withdraw from Gaza and all living hostages, soldier and civilian, would be released in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners.
Chief among Netanyahu's concerns this week will be what Trump wants.
The American president was not yet in office during the first round of ceasefire talks, though his team played a large role in pushing Israel toward a deal.
“Our decisions and the courage of our soldiers have redrawn the map,” Netanyahu said on the tarmac of Ben Gurion Airport Sunday.
“But I believe that, working closely with President Trump, we can redraw it even further and for the better.”.
But Gershon Baskin, a veteran Israeli negotiator and peace activist, said in a statement that Netanyahu's “refusal to begin negotiations on the day stipulated in the agreement is a clear violation of the agreement.”.
“Israel demands that Hamas adhere to all the terms of the agreement, while simultaneously violating it in a significant way.
Once again, Netanyahu is abandoning the hostages and endangering them.”.
Trump claimed credit for the current ceasefire and pledged upon taking office to end foreign wars.
But he has also now repeated his desire for the 2 million people of Gaza to leave so that “we just clean out that whole thing.”
The forced displacement of civilians can constitute “a war crime and/or crime against humanity,” according to the United Nations.
Trump's proposal was music to the ears of the most extreme minister in Netanyahu's governing coalition.
Finance minister Bezalel Smotrich, who vehemently opposed the withdrawal of Israeli forces and settlers from Gaza in 2005, wants Jews to resettle in the enclave.
“Encouraging migration (of Palestinians out of Gaza) is the only solution that will bring peace and security to the residents of Israel and alleviate the suffering of Gaza's Arab residents,” he said after Trump expressed his desire for Palestinians to leave.
Already one minister - the far-right Itamar Ben-Gvir - has withdrawn his party from the Israeli government over the ceasefire, calling it a capitulation.
Smotrich has pledged he will do the same if Israel does not renew the war in Gaza when the current, first phase of the ceasefire expires.

CNN — .
Researchers have detected organic compounds and minerals necessary for life in unprecedented samples collected from the near-Earth asteroid Bennu, adding evidence to the idea that asteroids likely delivered the building blocks of life to our planet early in its history.
The samples are also providing a window into understanding what kind of chemical and biological processes were already underway as space rocks chaotically ricocheted around during the early days of the solar system.
Preliminary analyses of the rock and dust samples released within the past year have shown that the asteroid contained water as well as carbon , nitrogen and other organic matter, but the chemical composition of the organic material was largely unknown.
Now, new research has revealed the asteroid contains many of the chemical building blocks of life, such as amino acids and components found in DNA, said Dr. Daniel P. Glavin, senior scientist for samples return at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.
“This is all very exciting because it suggests that asteroids like Bennu once acted like giant chemical factories in space and could have also delivered the raw ingredients for life to Earth and other bodies in our solar system,” said Glavin, lead author of a study on the samples published Wednesday in the journal Nature Astronomy .
Additionally, the authors of a separate paper published Wednesday in the journal Nature uncovered salts and minerals crucial to life, including some never seen in asteroid samples before, within Bennu's rocks — as well as highlighting the role that ancient water played on the asteroid.
The results of both papers, shared Wednesday during a NASA press conference, present a “groundbreaking scientific discovery,” said Nicky Fox, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate.
“These two papers together go hand in hand to say that Bennu was a much more interesting and complicated place than we probably gave it credit for even six months ago,” said Dr. Tim McCoy, co-lead author of the Nature study and curator of meteorites at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History.
Bennu is a carbon-rich space rock known as a rubble pile asteroid.
Scientists believe Bennu was once part of a larger “parent” asteroid that lost a few pieces due to an impact.
Then, those blasted-off pieces coalesced, like a pile of rocky rubble that is weakly held together by gravity.
The sample was collected from Bennu in October 2020 by a NASA mission called OSIRIS-REx, or Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification and Security-Regolith Explorer.
It marked the first time the US sent a spacecraft to briefly land on an asteroid and collect material.
The OSIRIS-REx spacecraft then dropped off a capsule when it swung by Earth in September 2023, sending it parachuting down into the Utah desert .
A team of researchers worked to carefully retrieve the capsule and ensure that the samples inside remained pristine and completely sealed against any of Earth's atmosphere and environment that could contaminate the extraterrestrial rocks and dust and potentially skew any analysis of its properties.
Scientists were thrilled when they realized that the capsule contained double the expected cache of material, which amounted to about 120 grams, or about the weight of a bar of soap.
Samples were divided up and shared with researchers around the globe.
Glavin and his team detected thousands of organic molecular compounds, including 33 amino acids, in the Bennu samples they studied.
Amino acids, or molecules that combine to form proteins, are some of the building blocks of life.
The researchers found 14 of the 20 amino acids that are used in biology to build proteins, and 19 non-protein amino acids, many of which are rare or nonexistent in known biology, Glavin said.
The team also detected adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymine and uracil — all five of the biological nucleobases, or components that make up the genetic code in DNA and RNA.
“These organic molecules have all been found previously in meteorites, but in contrast to meteorites, the Bennu samples are pristine and were protected from heating during atmospheric entry and exposure to terrestrial contamination,” Glavin said.
“So we have a much higher confidence now that these chemical building blocks of life are in fact extraterrestrial in origin and formed in space, and are not contaminants from Earth.”.
Glavin's team also found compounds rich in nitrogen and ammonia in the samples, suggesting that Bennu was part of a larger asteroid that formed about 4.5 billion years ago in the frigid, distant regions of the solar system.
Ammonia is essential for many biological processes, Glavin said.
Ammonia ice is more stable the farther it is from a heat source, like the sun.
The researchers believe that the ammonia-enriched ice melted inside the large parent asteroid body, estimated to be bigger than 62 miles (100 kilometers) in diameter, creating a liquid environment inside the rock that allowed complex organic molecules, such as the amino acids and nucleobases, to form.
“Having studied meteorites for 35 years, these record the first half billion years of our solar system history that were wiped out by plate tectonics and volcanism and the water cycle here on Earth,” McCoy said.
“I thought we were going to learn about the earliest geologic history of our solar system.
What we ended up finding was a lot of information about the earliest biologic history of our solar system, which is remarkable.”.
McCoy's team, including 66 researchers across four continents, found the salt and minerals left behind as water on Bennu, or its larger parent asteroid, evaporated.
The minerals include sodium phosphates, carbonates, sulfates, chlorides and fluorides, some of which are necessary to the formation of life.
The team was surprised to find the mineral trona, also known as sodium carbonate or soda ash, which has never been directly observed in another asteroid or meteorite.
On Earth, it is used in cleaning products and glass manufacturing.
The researchers believe that pockets or veins of water flowed beneath the surface of Bennu's parent asteroid, which was probably similar to a big ball of mud in the early days of the solar system, McCoy said.
Cracks and fractures in the asteroid allowed water to evaporate to the surface, leaving behind a concentrated brine, or a “soup of the elements,” in its wake.
This concentrated brine, similar to the salty crusts of dry lakebeds on Earth, is where salts and minerals could mingle and create more complex structures, setting the stage for organic compounds to form.
“We now know from Bennu that the raw ingredients of life were combining in really interesting and complex ways on Bennu's parent body,” McCoy said.
“We have discovered that next step on a pathway to life.
But we don't know how far along that pathway this environment could allow things to progress.”.
Brines are of interest to planetary scientists because they could be environments that support the formation of life.
It's also possible that they exist on other worlds in our solar system, including ocean worlds such as Saturn's icy moon Enceladus — which also contains sodium carbonate.
The presence of water, minerals, salts and amino acids suggests it was possible for the building blocks of life to come together in interesting ways on Bennu, but Glavin said more research is required to determine how organic compounds formed and evolved on the space rock.
Many of the minerals have small bits of water trapped in their crystalline structures, so researchers may be able to learn about how the composition of the brine changed over time, which could provide clarity about what took place in the evaporating water, McCoy said.
One of the mysteries presented by the samples is a mixture of amino acids.
Amino acids have handedness, meaning they can be created in two mirror-image versions, like a pair of hands.
On Earth, life produces left-handed amino acids, so Glavin expected to see that reflected in the Bennu samples — but it contains an equal mixture of both, suggesting that amino acids likely began on Earth as both.
Now, Glavin and his colleagues wonder why life on Earth “turned left” rather than right.
The combination of material found in the samples suggests chemical building blocks of life were widespread throughout the solar system, providing strong evidence that the asteroids bombarding early Earth may have delivered water and organic material to its surface, Glavin noted.
But that theory raises the question of whether this life-delivering bombardment ever successfully occurred on any other planet in the solar system, McCoy said.
And there is also the puzzle of why life didn't form inside Bennu itself, given that most of the raw ingredients needed were present, Glavin said.
“Maybe it was because there just wasn't enough time to do the more complex organic chemistry need for life before the salty liquids evaporated in the parent body,” Glavin said.
“Future missions to other bodies in our solar system will be critical to seek the answers about how life began on Earth and our search for life elsewhere.”.

Title: TikTok's parent company is in active discussions about a deal, board member says | CNN Business
# TikTok's parent company is in active discussions about a deal, board member says | CNN Business.
New York CNN — .
A board member at TikTok's parent company said that a deal to save the app from disappearing in the United States will be done soon.
General Atlantic CEO Bill Ford, a ByteDance board member, said Wednesday that it's in “everyone's interest” to keep the app active.
Ford made the remarks at an Axios-sponsored event in Davos, Switzerland.
“We'll get on with it, as soon as maybe the end of the week in terms of negotiating what might work…
The Chinese government, the US government and the company and the board all have to be involved in this conversation,” Ford said, adding that there could be solutions “short of divestiture.
” General Atlantic is a major investor in TikTok-owner ByteDance.
One of President Donald Trump's first acts after taking office Monday was signing an executive action that delays enforcement of the TikTok ban for 75 days.
The action directs the US Justice Department not to enforce the Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which passed with broad bipartisan support in Congress and was signed in April by former President Joe Biden.
The law required that starting January 19, TikTok be banned in the US unless it sells to a buyer from America or one of its allies.
Trump told reporters that he would be open to the sale of only a 50% stake , and that he changed his mind on TikTok because he “got to use it.” .
Trump is also talking about TikTok as a deal-making exercise, saying Tuesday that “I have the right to make a deal” and rhetorically repositioning the US law banning TikTok as a big business opportunity for the US and his tech mogul friends.
Trump added that said he would be open to X owner Elon Musk or Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison taking over the app.
Investor groups led by billionaire Frank McCourt and YouTuber and TikTok star Jimmy Donaldson, also known as MrBeast , also have made bids for TikTok for undisclosed sums.
For now, TikTok's ultimate fate in America remains in doubt until a deal is made.
It's unclear that ByteDance would want to sell, even if it were a deal brokered by Trump.

Title: French AI chatbot taken offline after wild answers led to online ridicule | CNN Business
# French AI chatbot taken offline after wild answers led to online ridicule | CNN Business.
CNN — .
A French-language artificial intelligence chatbot backed by the French government has been taken offline after providing nonsensical answers to simple mathematical equations, and even recommending that one user eat cow's eggs.
In a statement Saturday, the Linagora Group, a company that is part of a consortium developing the model, named Lucie, said it remains an “academic research project in its early stages.”.
Lucie was released “prematurely,” said Linagora, adding that it should have been clearer in informing users of the limitations of the model in its current form.
“We were carried away by our own enthusiasm,” the statement reads.
Michel-Marie Maudet, general director of Linagora Group, told CNN that the team would now update its model and then test a beta version in private before a public relaunch.
After Lucie was launched Thursday, users took to social media to share its erroneous answers, including a response to a user query asking the chatbot to tell them about cow's eggs.
“Cow's eggs, also known as chicken's eggs, are edible eggs produced by cows,” Lucie was quoted as replying.
“Cow's eggs are a source of protein and nutrients, and are considered to be a healthy and nutritious food.”.
Asked to multiply 5 by (3+2), the model gave an answer of 17, instead of 25, and Lucie also said that “the square root of a goat is one,” users reported.
Launched with ambitions of challenging the dominance of the English language in AI and providing an alternative to models such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Lucie is named after the oldest human ancestor, said Linagora.
Its logo is inspired by both Marianne, a national symbol of France, and the US actress Scarlett Johansson, who starred in the film “Lucy,” according to a statement from Linagora published on January 3.
“Lucie is covered by a blue, white and red shawl, demonstrating her sovereign French personality,” the statement added.
Lucie has been backed by French President Emmanuel Macron as part of his France 2030 investment program, which includes a wide range of projects worth a total of €54 billion ($56.8 billion)..
And Macron is currently preparing to host the Artificial Intelligence Action Summit, which will bring world leaders and tech figures to Paris from February 10 to 11.

Title: The Fed's go-to inflation gauge heated up again | CNN Business
# The Fed's go-to inflation gauge heated up again | CNN Business.
CNN — .
The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge moved even higher in December, driven largely by rising energy prices as well as food.
However, a closely watched measurement of underlying inflation trends indicated some progress in the fight to rein in price hikes.
The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index rose 2.6% in December from the year before, heating up from November's 2.4% increase , according to new Commerce Department data released Friday.
On a monthly basis, prices rose 0.3% as compared to 0.1% in November.
That acceleration was in line with economists' expectations, which called for a 0.3% increase from November and a 2.6% annual gain, according to FactSet consensus estimates.
The core PCE price index, which excludes the more volatile components of gas and food, hit expectations on the nose: It rose 0.2% from November and the annual rate of underlying inflation held pat at 2.8% for the third month in a row, according to the report.
Inflation has cooled substantially since peaking in the summer of 2022, and that progress continued through 2024 to the point where an elusive “soft landing”— price stability without having the economy tank into a recession — remained achievable as Joe Biden wrapped up his presidency.
The PCE price index is part of the Commerce Department's monthly Personal Income and Outlays report, which includes comprehensive data on how Americans earn, spend and save.
And in December, they ramped up their spending significantly.
Consumer spending shot up 0.7% from November, exceeding economists' expectations for a 0.5% gain.
With Thanksgiving landing late in November, the holiday shopping season was largely concentrated in December ; also, the increase likely reflected some replacement purchases of cars, furniture and other goods damaged by the two major hurricanes that hit in October 2024, Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon, told CNN Friday.
Another likely factor is that consumers also were buying more durable goods in anticipation of tariffs that have been threatened by President Donald Trump, Samuel Tombs, Pantheon Macroeconomics' chief US economist, wrote in a note to clients on Friday.
Purchases of TVs, technology products and autos have notably surged, he noted.
Trump on Thursday reiterated plans to slap a 25% tariff on imports from both Canada and Mexico.
“Consumers shop with an eye on bargains, and 25% tariffs of the imports of America's two largest trading partners could force prices of store-bought goods well beyond the reach of many if not all consumers,” economist Chris Rupkey of FwdBonds wrote in commentary on Friday.
“There may not be another full-blown cost of living crisis, but the future with tariffs certainly looks less affordable for all Americans.”.
“We are not sure the country is willing to pay the price for the new administration's social goals of stopping migrants and illicit drugs at the border,” he added.
The sheer rate of spending does not appear to be sustainable, Pantheon's Tombs noted.
Households' personal saving rate — savings as a percentage after tax — was the lowest in two years, Commerce Department data shows.
The saving rate dropped to 3.8% from 4.1% in November, according to Friday's report.
“It now is 2 percentage points below its 2015-to-19 average,” Tombs said.
Consumers also are leaning more on their credit cards.
The share of people making just the minimum payment on their credit cards hit a 12-year high, according to third-quarter 2024 data released last week by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.
“It's an orange flag,” EY-Parthenon's Daco told CNN.
“We're noticing that there is a bifurcation in the consumer outlook in that the consumers at the lower-to-medium end of the income spectrum are spending more judiciously in a high-price, high-interest-rate environment.”.
The strong momentum seen in the consumer spending data has largely been driven by higher income individuals, he said.
Overall, personal income grew 0.4% in December, marking a slight acceleration from the 0.3% gain seen the month before, according to Friday's report.
“The monthly numbers add some more light on the income side of the economy,” Eugenio Alemán, chief economist at Raymond James, wrote Friday.
“This showed that consumers are deploying their savings to 'keep up with the Joneses,' which could become a problem down the line.”.
Friday's release marked the final inflation report for 2024, and while the last chapter showed a “bump in the road” during the fourth quarter, the underlying fundamentals remain disinflationary, Daco said.
That story should continue through the first couple of months of this year, he said, noting disinflationary dynamics like cautious consumer spending, constrained pricing power, strong productivity growth, easing shelter cost inflation, slowing insurance-related inflation and cooling wage growth. (Separately, on Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that workers' compensation grew 3.8% for the year ended in December, slowing from a 3.9% rate notched in September.) .
However, he added, the inflationary risks are much higher than they were before the election, he added.
“As we look further out, then you might start to see the pressures from some of the policies that are put in place — immigration restrictions; perhaps even some deregulation; and tariffs, of course, are big, big unknowns,” he said.
“But their effect on the economy is likely to take a bit more time.”.
The path to the Fed's 2% inflation target was expected to be long and bumpy, and it has been a little choppy the past couple of months, prompting the central bank to take a more cautious approach to rate cuts in 2025.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that inflation remains elevated; but the labor market is solid, and the economy is strong, so the central bank doesn't have to hurry more rate cuts.
He also indicated policymakers are taking a wait-and-see approach as some of Trump's sweeping policy moves come to fruition.

Title: Early signs of dementia can show in your finances | CNN Business
# Early signs of dementia can show in your finances | CNN Business.
New York CNN — .
Financial files in disarray.
Late payments and last-warning service-cutoff notices.
Multiple daily bank withdrawals.
Out-of-character purchases.
When a family member who has been fairly responsible with money all their lives becomes careless with their finances, it may be one sign of as-yet-undiagnosed dementia .
Researchers at the New York Federal Reserve who analyzed both US credit reporting and Medicare data found that in the five years before a dementia diagnosis, a person's average credit scores may start to weaken and their payment delinquencies rise.
“The harmful financial effects of undiagnosed memory disorders exacerbate the already substantial financial pressure households face upon diagnosis,” the researchers wrote.
“Beyond susceptibility to payment delinquency, early stage [Alzheimer's disease and related disorders] may affect new account openings and debt accumulation, credit utilization, and/or credit mix.”.
Their findings echo the results of a 2020 study from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health .
Marcey Tidwell, who lives in Bloomington, Indiana, said those findings are “not remotely shocking.”
Tidwell's mother was diagnosed with a form of dementia in 2020 and has been living with her daughter ever since.
Tidwell said that for most of her life, her mother was an “outrageously methodical human being” who kept the bills paid and the family records organized across many moves as her husband pursued a career in the military.
After going through her mother's papers this year, Tidwell surmises that her mother's memory started faltering around 2015, because from that point forward her record-keeping became “less than pristine.”.
For example, Tidwell said, her mom used to keep an immaculate record of checks written and deposits and withdrawals made in her checkbook register.
But that register became a mess.
“There was a bunch of stuff scratched out and she was obsessively adding and re-adding — she knew things weren't all they could be.
Later on, I saw that she took out large amounts of her savings, more than she needed for groceries.”.
Karen Lemay, who lives in Ottawa, Canada, knew something was really wrong with her father in 2022 when she saw on his desk piles of late-payment notices and final-notification warnings from service providers and insurers.
Her father was a former finance executive who “was very conservative with his money, very smart about it and never reckless with it,” she said.
And he had strongly impressed upon his daughter the importance of paying off her credit card in full every month to avoid interest.
Yet Lemay discovered he owed $50,000 in charges, interest and late payment fees on a Visa card.
He also financed the purchase of a new car he didn't need, just months before police took away his driver's license.
Normally, he would only buy high-end used cars with cash, she said.
What's more, his daughter noted, he failed to pay his 2021 taxes.
So he ended up owing the government roughly $20,000, the bulk of which was for late payment and underpayment penalties.
“I spoke to him about some of his balances and he refused to believe he hadn't paid them,” Lemay said.
Jayne Sibley, who lives in the United Kingdom, knows the pain and stress of dealing with the financial behaviors that can signal dementia.
Her father and mother were both diagnosed with different forms of it.
Her father moved into a nursing home years ago, but her now-deceased mother remained in her own home, albeit with live-in care.
“The most challenging thing we faced was managing mum's everyday money as her condition progressed.
She would overspend on things she didn't need or want.
Random items, cleaning equipment, luxury food.
She also fell victim to scams over the phone — a fake insurance policy, those sorts of things,” Sibley said.
Her mother also would take money out of the cash machine two to three times a day and give it to anyone who asked.
Acutely aware of how high long-term care costs were, given her father's situation, Sibley said she worried that her mother would run through the money that would be needed for her own care.
While her mother's condition made her vulnerable with money, she initially was still able to walk and shop and go to yoga on her own.
In other words, she was able to maintain a lot of her autonomy and social ties.
To try to stem the money outflow, Sibley and her brother tried doling out a week's worth of cash for their mother “but she'd spend it all in one go,” she said.
Ditto when they tried divvying the cash up into daily envelopes.
Eventually, they took away her cash card.
But, soon after, her condition worsened, Sibley said.
“She wasn't able to maintain her familiar routines and social connections.
That's when we realized there has to be a better way.”.
With her husband, she founded Sibstar , which offers a debit card in the UK that can be used by a person with dementia to maintain some sense of financial autonomy and social engagement.
When needed, family caregivers can monitor their debit transactions via an app.
As a person's condition worsens, the caregiver can set limits on how much money can be spent on any given day or week, and where the card can be used (eg, at cash machines, online or at the grocery store). .
While there are few dementia-specific financial tools to reduce the odds that someone squanders their own hard-earned money, there are steps you can take to make it easier to assume control over another person's finances when they become incapacitated.
In 2008, a year after her father died without a will and a dozen years before her mother was diagnosed with dementia, Tidwell said she and her siblings took their mother to a lawyer to make sure she had a will, named her medical proxy and named the person to whom she would give power of attorney to handle her financial affairs should the need arise.
That made it easier for Tidwell, among other things, to get online access in 2018 to her mother's bank account to make sure nothing was amiss.
By 2020, she had automated her mother's bill paying online.
“The time to make plans is before you need to.
It's hard to overstate what a gift that trip to the lawyer in 2008 was to 'future me,'
” said Tidwell, who fully manages her mother's finances now that her condition has worsened considerably.
Since dementia can worsen over time and because someone in the initial stages may not recognize they are more vulnerable to financial errors and scams, the US National Institute on Aging recommends that a family take steps early on to alleviate those concerns, such as setting up automated bill payments for the person with dementia.
Of course, no amount of advanced financial planning can alleviate the heartbreak of watching a loved one with dementia decline.
“I prepared as best as I could, but it's still hard,” Tidwell said.
That's why she advises anyone potentially facing a similar situation to, in her words, “make the easy part easy.” .

Title: Costco and Teamsters reach a tentative deal to avert a strike | CNN Business
# Costco and Teamsters reach a tentative deal to avert a strike | CNN Business.
New York CNN — .
A threatened strike at 56 Costco stores across six states has been averted for now, as the company and negotiators for the Teamsters union, representing 18,000 workers, reached an 11th hour tentative agreement, the union told CNN early Saturday morning.
Full terms of the deal were not immediately available.
Costco did not respond a request for comment.
The strike would have been the largest ever at an American retail chain, and the first ever at the big box retailer.
Beyond wages and benefits, the union also had demands regarding seniority pay, paid family leave, bereavement policies, sick time, and safeguards against surveillance.
The agreement, announced several hours after the contract expired at 11:59pm PT Friday, does not completely end the threat of a strike.
It would still need to be ratified by rank-and-file members of the union at Costco before it goes into effect.
Last fall, unionized workers at Boeing voted down a tentative deal its union leadership had reached with the aircraft maker and started a strike that lasted two months.
But most tentative deals do result in a final contract.
Teamsters members at Costco make up 8% of its 219,000 employees at 616 US stores, according to company filings.
But a strike by that many workers would behave been significant for the largely non-union sector of the economy.
Labor Department statistics show that less than 5% of retail workers are represented by unions.
Most of those unionized retail workers work in grocery stores.
The specific locations of the unionized stores have not been identified by either the union or company.
But the union said they are in six states along the East and West Coasts - Maryland, New Jersey, New York and Virginia as well as California and Washington state, the latter being Costco's corporate home.
Costco had said on Friday that even if its unionized workers had gone on strike, “all of our locations will be open for business this weekend,” an indication that it intended to use management and non-union staff to keep stores operating.
And even though the Teamsters only represent workers at a small fraction of Costco stores overall, it was prepared to set up picket lines at an undisclosed number of non-union Costco stores nationwide, even if workers at those stores remained on the job.
Such a move could have greatly increased the economic pressure on the company.
While there are only 18,000 Teamsters at Costco, the union has more than 1 million US members it can call on for other picket lines.
Costco has a reputation for providing relatively good pay and benefits, especially compared to other retail chains.
Its annual company filing states that “our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits.
Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover, increasing productivity and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average.”.
Costco confirmed a Reuters report that it recently sent a letter out to all employees at non-union stores announcing it was raising pay by a dollar an hour, to $30.20 this year and another dollar an hour each of the next two years.
Starting pay would be raised by 50 cents an hour to $20..
The Teamsters have pointed to Costco's strong financial results as an argument for an improved wage and benefits package.
Costco reported record annual net income in the most recent fiscal year of $7.4 billion — up 17% from a year earlier and nearly double what it earned in 2019 ahead of the Covid-19 pandemic.
At a recent union rally held outside Costco's annual meeting, union members held banners reading: “Pro worker?
Prove it!
” and “Record profits = record contract.”.
Last year, the Teamsters staged a five-day strike at Amazon that ended the day after Christmas.
But unlike the situation at Costco, Amazon does not recognize the union as representing any of its workers and has refused to negotiate, let alone agree to terms on a contract.
Amazon doesn't even recognize that many of the strikers, who are officially drivers for third-party delivery services despite exclusively delivering packages for the online retailer, are its employees.
This is a developing story.
It will be updated.

Title: Arab nations reject Trump's call to relocate Gazans to neighboring countries | CNN
# Arab nations reject Trump's call to relocate Gazans to neighboring countries | CNN.
CNN — .
A key group of Arab nations have said they “firmly” reject any efforts to resettle or evict Palestinians from Gaza, after US President Donald Trump said he wanted to “clean out” the enclave and move its population to neighboring countries.
The foreign ministers of Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt issued a wide-ranging statement Saturday, saying they hoped to work with Trump on a two-state solution in the Middle East.
But they pushed back on Trump's suggestion to relocate Palestinians from Gaza.
Without specifically referencing the president's proposal, the ministers reiterated a commitment to rebuilding the enclave while ensuring “the continued presence of Palestinians in their homeland.” .
The nations “firmly rejected any actions that threaten these rights, including settlement expansion, forced evictions, home demolitions, land annexation, or the displacement of Palestinians through direct expulsion or coerced migration,” they wrote after a meeting of the foreign ministers in Cairo.
In January, Trump said he had spoken with the king of Jordan about potentially building housing elsewhere in the Middle East and moving more than 1 million Palestinians from Gaza to neighboring countries.
“I said to him that I'd love you to take on more, because I'm looking at the whole Gaza Strip right now and it's a mess, it's a real mess,” he told reporters aboard Air Force One.
“You're talking about a million and a half people, and we just clean out that whole thing.”.
“I don't know, something has to happen, but it's literally a demolition site right now,” Trump said.
“Almost everything's demolished, and people are dying there, so I'd rather get involved with some of the Arab nations and build housing in a different location where I think they could maybe live in peace for a change.”.
The statement from the Arab foreign ministers touched on a range of topics relating to Gaza's reconstruction, as the fragile ceasefire between Hamas and Israel allows the region to assess the impact of a brutal 15-month conflict.
The group hailed “the important role played by the United States in facilitating the deal,” for which both Trump and his predecessor Joe Biden have sought credit.
They also “called for the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and rejected any attempts to partition the Strip,” and pointed to the “indispensable role” of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees or UNRWA, two days after Israel's ban on the agency went into effect.

Title: Trump DOJ appointee in DC lashes out after flurry of 'personally insulting' leaks in his first week | CNN Politics
# Trump DOJ appointee in DC lashes out after flurry of 'personally insulting' leaks in his first week | CNN Politics.
CNN — .
The acting top federal prosecutor in Washington under President Donald Trump is furious about recent leaks to the press and also specifically directed staff to scrutinize a former official's work on January 6 cases after she rebuked him on TV, according to internal emails obtained by CNN.
Ed Martin, the interim US attorney for DC, sent an email Tuesday to his entire office, complaining that someone leaked an email he sent Monday.
In the Monday email, he launched an internal review of how prosecutors handled some January 6, 2021, cases where the Supreme Court concluded that prosecutors overstepped with charging decisions.
In the Tuesday email blast, Martin said: “Wow, what a disappointment to have my email yesterday to you all was leaked almost immediately.
Again, personally insulting and professionally unacceptable.
I guess I have learned my lesson ('Fool me once…').”.
The latest missive from Martin highlights his turbulent first week, as he aggressively tries to impose Trump's agenda at the Justice Department, while facing pushback both internally from career prosecutors and others who quit and then bashed his actions.
Martin is a socially conservative activist and commentator and was involved with the 2020 election denier movement.
In his Tuesday email, he lashed out at a prosecutor who was involved in January 6 cases and resigned after Trump granted mass clemency that ended all of the nearly 1,600 cases and wiped away all remaining prison terms.
That ex-prosecutor, Ashley Akers, gave at least four TV interviews Monday, with multiple appearances on MSNBC and CNN , where she condemned many of Martin's moves.
Akers said she had a “guttural reaction” when Trump chose to “immediately absolve” the January 6 defendants.
She said it was “appalling” that Martin was “advocating on behalf of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers” by successfully urging a judge to nix their travel restrictions .
And she called his internal review of January 6 cases a “wild goose chase.” .
In response, Martin sent an officewide email Tuesday rebuking Akers for “going on television badmouthing our work (and me!).”
He said, “we will need to make sure we have her records and emails,” including for his review of January 6 prosecutions. (Akers' name was misspelled in the email.).
“I have never met her so I find her comments disconnected from reality - not a credit to our office,” Martin wrote in the email.
“She mentioned 'fear' (and used the word 'guttural') - I am not sure to what she is referring …
I will be reaching out to her.
Maybe she had issues with her supervisors or my predecessor.
We will see if we can help her.”.
Akers declined to comment about Martin's emails.
A spokesperson for the US attorney's office didn't respond to a request for comment.
In a separate email last week that was also obtained by CNN, Martin said he had a “great” first day in the office, but was dismayed that someone leaked details about a conversation they had.
In many of his emails, Martin has complained about these leaks.
“Unfortunately, immediately after our 'get to know you' meetings, one of the attendees leaked to the press about a specific detail,” Martin wrote in the officewide email that CNN obtained.
“This is personally insulting, of course, and professionally unacceptable.
If you are the person or person who leaked, feel free to contact me directly.”.

Title: Federal agents in immigration operations told to be camera-ready as hundreds arrested | CNN Politics
# Federal agents in immigration operations told to be camera-ready as hundreds arrested | CNN Politics.
CNN — .
The Trump administration's immigration sweeps that included more than 2,000 arrests in two days and have chilled many immigrant communities were followed by another blitz: A barrage of video and photos from the federal government showing agents in tactical gear and vests emblazoned with “Police ICE” and “Homeland Security” taking cuffed suspects away.
The made-for-TV look of the arrests is not a coincidence.
At least two agencies assisting US immigration officials with the sweeps ordered by the fledgling Republican White House have told personnel to ensure their clothing clearly depicts their respective agency in case they are filmed by journalists, sources familiar with the operations tell CNN.
While it is a common safety practice for agents conducting arrests to wear insignias clearly identifying themselves as law enforcement, even agents on the perimeter of operations conducted across the nation have been specifically instructed by their leadership to wear raid jackets in view of media attention, sources said.
On Sunday, federal agencies released numerous photos on social media of agents in tactical gear conducting purported immigration arrests.
TV talk show host Dr. Phil McGraw announced on social media he was “embedded” with an Immigration and Customs Enforcement team in Chicago as operations began.
McGraw released video showing him interviewing the Trump administration's new “border czar,” Tom Homan, at what was described as an ICE command center.
Inviting a celebrity guest to the Chicago operations was frustrating to Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul, a Democrat, who told CNN's Jim Acosta his office has not received any notice about the arrests despite working with federal law enforcement in the past.
“I think it's done for the show, and I think it's done to upset community and to score political points with those who want to divide,” said Raoul.
Democratic US Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois said his offices would help anyone who was improperly arrested.
“We can all agree we that must remove dangerous individuals who are here illegally,” Durbin wrote in a post on X .
“But the actions being taken by the Trump admin go beyond those goals.” .
In addition to Chicago, immigration actions were reported in California, Texas, Georgia, Ohio, Michigan, Colorado, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, according to Homeland Security and the Drug Enforcement Administration.
“We're prioritizing criminal aliens,” Homan told CNN on Sunday, but added, “There's going to be a point where we have to open the aperture to fugitives.”.
## Arrests reported at homes and a church .
Arrests of undocumented immigrants, including those with no criminal record, have been reported across the country.
Jennifer Jimenez, whose cousin was detained by federal agents in Newark, New Jersey, last week, said her cousin was not in the United States to “create any harm” — he just wanted to provide for his family.
Jimenez told CNN's Erin Burnett on Monday her cousin David is a “hard-working man” and does not have a criminal record.
He has been in the United States for about four years, she said.
Federal agents detained multiple people Thursday during what ICE called “a targeted enforcement operation.”
Jimenez described agents coming into the business where her cousin worked and asking for his identification before they took him to a detention center.
The agents “raided” the local business and detained “undocumented residents as well as citizens, without producing a warrant,” Newark Mayor Ras Baraka said in a statement at the time.
Jimenez said her cousin came to the United States to take care of his family and pay medical bills.
His younger sister died of cancer and had a young daughter, whom he was raising, Jimenez said.
Federal agents “don't know the reason that they're coming here,” Jimenez said of immigrants.
“It's not for them to create any harm.
It's for them to prosper, to keep their family alive.”.
The enforcement action was in response to a tip reporting unauthorized workers at a place of business, a law enforcement source briefed on the investigation in Newark told CNN.
A suburban Chicago woman said her father — a native of Mexico — had been living in the Unites States for nearly 30 years when he was arrested Sunday after agents knocked on his door.
“They would open the door because they thought maybe one of (his children) were in trouble or something happened to us,” Yelitza Marquina told CNN affiliate WLS .
“Never did he think they were ICE.” .
One undocumented man was taken into custody by ICE while attending church Sunday in Tucker, Georgia, his pastor told CNN.
Luis Ortiz was in the middle of his sermon when he saw the man being escorted out by other congregants.
He was told ICE agents did not enter the building but asked for the man by name.
Former acting director of ICE under the Obama administration, John Sandweg, told CNN's Laura Coates that, under Trump's new policy, more “collateral arrests” are being made.
“When you go to a home where you've identified one of your primary target lives, oftentimes you find they're not the only undocumented immigrant living in the home.
They might have family members who are undocumented,” Sandweg said.
“In the Biden administration or Obama administration, you don't take those people into custody unless they also pose a threat to public safety,” Sandweg said.
“Under the Trump administration, they've been very open about arresting everybody in the house.
That does drive up the number of arrests.”.
Adult migrants have stopped going to work and children are not going to school out of fear they could be arrested at any time, a Chicago-based non-profit assisting immigrants told CNN.
The charity asked not to be named because of fear of retaliation.
In the Atlanta area, the DeKalb County School District sent a note to school families advising them the district will not voluntarily allow immigration agents into their schools.
“As with any unauthorized visitor, entrance beyond the main office and access to students or their information is prohibited without a court order or exigent circumstances,” wrote Superintendent Devon Horton.
A coalition of Quaker groups filed a lawsuit in Maryland on Monday to stop the Department of Homeland Security from enacting its new policy of allowing immigration enforcement near places of worship.
The lawsuit asks the court to declare as unconstitutional the newly created policy by the Trump administration to conduct immigration enforcement near or at houses of worship, dictated by an individual agent's “common sense.”
The lawsuit says religious exercise is an essential service, and preventing congregants from attending services creates “a substantial burden” on the plaintiff's own rights.
Nationwide, 1,179 people were arrested Monday and 853 immigration detainers were lodged, ICE said in a post on X. This comes after 956 people were arrested and 554 detainers were lodged Sunday, ICE said in a post on X , marking the highest numbers since the agency started reporting them on the platform.
ICE will continue “enhanced operations” across the Southeast about two to three times a week, according to a source with knowledge of the operations.
They will involve the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, with the agencies given authority to apprehend immigrants .
ICE is casting a wide net, but its primary target is Tren de Aragua , a transnational criminal gang that originated in a Venezuelan prison, according to the source.
Not all communities with large immigrant communities appear to be concerned by the sweeps.
“Most of my constituents are fine.
My constituents are here legally,” said US Rep. Carlos Giménez, a Republican who represents a portion of Miami-Dade County, Florida.
Trump defeated Kamala Harris in that county, with its large Cuban population, by more than 125,000 votes in 2024.
“That's what President Trump ran on, and he is complying with his promises,” Giménez told CNN's Pamela Brown.
Chicago and several other “sanctuary cities” are also the subject of a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee investigation announced Monday.
House Committee Chairman James Comer, a Republican from Kentucky, sent letters to the mayors of Boston, Chicago, Denver and New York and requested documents and information related to those cities' policies.
Sanctuary jurisdiction is a term broadly applied to cities that have policies to limit cooperation with or involvement in federal immigration enforcement actions.
In response to the investigation, a spokesperson for the city of Boston said, “We are proud that Boston is the safest major city in the United States.
We have received the letter and are reviewing it.”.
Denver Mayor Mike Johnston said in a statement, “The most helpful thing Congressional Republicans could do right now is fix our broken immigration system.
While they work on that, we will focus on running the cities that manage the consequences of their failure to act.”.
And a spokesperson for New York Mayor Eric Adams told CNN he “has made clear that New York City is committed to working with our federal partners to fix our broken immigration system and focus on the small number of people who are entering our localities and committing violent crimes.
We will review the letter and respond accordingly.”.
CNN has reached out to the office of Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson.
ICE agents are “actually very good” at identifying people when they are booked into jail and putting a detainer on them, Sanweg explained.
“But sometimes people get out,” he said.
“And then, to be fair - with some of the administration's rhetoric in a sanctuary city - they are less likely to give ICE agents access to the jails.
So that increases the number of targets out on the street … that's the primary tactic for the targeting piece of this.
Pressed by CNN's Kaitlan Collins on the administration's departure from long-standing policy by allowing federal immigration agents to conduct arrests at churches and schools, Homan said: “There's no safe haven for public safety.” .
“Again, it takes a lot to get approval to go into a school or church.
But if there's a national security threat, we're going,” he said.
Local authorities in several cities have highlighted their policies of not participating in federal immigration raids since the Trump administration launched its immigration crackdown.
The Chicago Police Department said in a statement to CNN it does not document immigration status, and in accordance with its “Welcoming City Ordinance,”
“does not share information with federal immigration authorities.”.
In San Jose, California, “we do not have our local police officers engaged in the enforcement actions that are primarily related to somebody's status or enforcing an immigration law,” Mayor Matt Mahan told CNN's Erin Burnett on Monday.
And in Sunnyside, a city in central Washington where city manager Mike Gonzalez said the vast majority of residents are Latino, local police and authorities will not participate in federal immigration efforts, he said after several arrests were reported there.
After the arrest of 20 people at a local business near Cleveland, Ohio, Cleveland Heights city officials said in a statement that they “did not have prior knowledge of, was not involved in, nor did it cooperate or coordinate with federal officials from ICE in a raid,” according to CNN affiliate WOIO .
Alternately, in Nassau County, a suburb of New York on Long Island with a significant migrant community, local law enforcement have said they're ready and willing to help federal immigration efforts.
“Nassau County Police and Sheriff Departments are fully cooperating with ICE and other federal agencies to round up illegal migrants starting with the worst first,” Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, a Republican, told CNN in a statement Monday.
Teams across the country have been given various quotas for the number of so-called “high-profile” immigration sweeps they should conduct each month, one source said, with the goal being to beat the number of administrative arrests made by Immigration and Customs Enforcement last year.
ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations conducted 113,431 administrative arrests in the fiscal year that ended October 2024, according to an agency report .
That's about 310 arrests a day.
Homan denied imposing an arrest quota on ICE officers.
“I don't have a number.
As many as we can arrest and deport,” he told Collins. “
The more money we have, the more we can do.”.
Whether there is a firm arrest quota or not, Sandweg said he's concerned the pressure to rack up large arrest numbers could result in heavy-handed tactics.
“What I'm very interested to see is in the next few weeks as these target lists get exhausted — as they just run out of the easy pickings of the people connected to the criminal justice system — what operational tactics are they going to utilize that feed the machinery that the Trump administration has built?” he said.
About 11 million undocumented immigrants live in the United States, the Pew Research Center's latest estimates indicate.
Federal law enforcement agencies have been told to prioritize deporting a wide swath of criminal suspects under investigation who may be “out of status,” a law enforcement source familiar with the latest operations tells CNN.
Someone who is out of status may have entered the United States legally but has violated the terms of their visa or other immigration requirements.
If a suspect under investigation by agencies such as the FBI, ATF or DEA is in the country unlawfully, and an indictment for non-immigration criminal offenses investigated by those agencies is not likely in the near term, the source said, investigators have been told to consider “just getting them out.”.
The new posture is notable because crimes investigated by federal law enforcement agencies can take weeks or even several months to prove and prosecute.
However, under the new guidance from Trump administration officials, agencies have been told to opt for deportation of undocumented suspects if a criminal indictment does not appear on the horizon.
Prior to taking office, Trump transition officials were asking law enforcement agencies about how many of their investigations involved non-US citizens, the source said.
CNN's Michelle Krupa, Lauren Mascarenhas, Gustavo Valdés, Zoe Sottile and Karina Tsui contributed to this report.

Title: Fear of flying: How to manage it | CNN
# Fear of flying: How to manage it | CNN.
Sign up for CNN's Stress, But Less newsletter.
Our six-part mindfulness guide will inform and inspire you to reduce stress while learning how to harness it . .
CNN — .
When air travel accidents such as the fatal midair collision near Washington, DC, occur, the consequences can reach much further than those directly affected by the tragedy.
It can also give rise or increase people's fear of flying, also known as aerophobia or aviophobia.
Many people have sat through plane delays due to mechanical issues, weather or other reasons, perhaps a bit concerned at the holdup but not terrified of what could happen.
“Almost every person has had some thought of, 'Oh, my plane is delayed.
I hope everything's safe and fine,'” said Dr. Gail Saltz, clinical associate professor of psychiatry at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City.
But it's not that simple for everyone.
“Some people have a tendency to have a thought become what's called sticky or obsessive,” Saltz added.
“They don't like the thought, but it sticks in their mind, and they can't really get it out.
This kind of event is a typical trigger for people to have some increase in anxiety about flying or a true aerophobia.” .
As one of the most common phobias, aerophobia affects more than 25 million adults in the United States, according to the Cleveland Clinic .
It most commonly affects people between ages 17 and 34 — “a time in life when significant changes occur, such as graduation, marriage or childbirth,” the clinic website notes.
“People may be scared that flying jeopardizes their life at such an important time.” .
In light of Wednesday night's tragic collision, Saltz discussed aerophobia's symptoms and how people can manage the phobia to help themselves recover rather than limit their lives. .
This conversation has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.
CNN: What's the difference between flight anxiety and a flying phobia? .
Dr. Gail Saltz: Flight anxiety is just anxiety about flying.
But diagnostically, there is a definition of aerophobia, and people with it have sets of symptoms.
There are physical symptoms of that fear — fast heartbeat, sweating, trembling, dizziness, nausea, shortness of breath, chest pain or vomiting.
They have emotional symptoms, so they feel panicky and worried.
There might be behavioral symptoms that make someone cancel a flight at the last minute because of their panic or decide to take a train for an obscene number of hours to avoid flying.
They might choose to not go on vacations or business trips and repeatedly seek reassurance about travel safety from other people.
Those symptoms can occur even the week before the flight or at any point when they're on the plane.
For flight anxiety to be considered a flying phobia, these symptoms need to have been the case for six months or more.
It needs to be interfering with their life in some way.
People who seek treatment usually have a debilitating phobia.
CNN: What causes aerophobia? .
Saltz: There's not one thing that causes any phobia, including fear of flying.
But you're more likely to experience aerophobia if you already have high anxiety .
Another factor is trauma, like a natural disaster experience or a terrible car accident — something where your life felt at risk.
Kids who have a parent with a fear of flying can acquire it from them.
CNN: What factors may worry someone with aerophobia? .
Saltz: Sometimes it's not even the flying per se.
Sometimes it's a fear of being in an enclosed thing in the air and not being able to get out.
It could be a fear of heights, of becoming motion sick and vomiting, of contagious illness or of takeoff, landing, thunderstorms or turbulence.
Everybody thinks that you're terrified that the plane will crash, but that's only a small number of flying phobias.
CNN: What ways of coping with aerophobia are unhelpful? .
Saltz: When you avoid or cancel a flight, you feel this great sense of relief.
That relief provides positive reinforcement to your brain, saying, “This was a good thing.
I avoided the danger.
I feel better now.” .
However, your world just shrunk a little smaller, and your fear, being reinforced by this, gets larger.
The one thing you don't want to do is avoid, and as hard as that is, it will help you diminish your fear.
Also, avoid drinking or taking sleeping pills or other drugs (to deal with your phobia) unless prescribed by a doctor.
That can be dangerous and cause dependence, and it won't give you the therapeutic benefit of exposing yourself to the flight and moving in the direction of recovery.
CNN: How can someone manage or overcome a fear of flying? .
Saltz: Phobias in general are one of the most common mental health conditions, and they're very treatable.
The treatment is exposure and response prevention — you have to expose yourself in some way to that feared situation and prevent your usual responses, which only make the phobia worse.
That's (done) by having a therapist guide you through and teach you all these relaxation and therapeutic techniques to manage your anxiety as it comes.
Over time, you essentially become desensitized to those triggers.
Virtual reality treatment guided by a therapist can also help.
See what you can do along the way to make flying the least unpleasant.
When you're feeling panicked, meditation, progressive muscle relaxation and 10 minutes of paced deep breathing can help.
You're inhaling through your nose to a count of five, holding it for a second or two, then exhaling through pursed lips to a count of seven.
Watching or listening to something that relaxes you can distract you from anxious thoughts.
If you're traveling with someone, discuss your thoughts with them.
For many people, their fear is based on flying just seeming like an impossible feat.
Educating themselves on the mechanics of aerodynamics is helpful.
It's called intellectualizing as a defense mechanism.
CNN: Some people may think, “Although plane accidents are rare, I never know if I'm going to be on one of those flights that end in disaster.”
How can they cope with that awareness? .
Saltz: While I said these are irrational fears, of course any fear can have a kernel of truth to it, and most of these do.
One thing experts do is educate patients about the statistics to put things into perspective — like how you are much more likely to die in a car accident, get hit by a car while crossing the street or even be struck by lightning than you are to die in a plane crash.
And you get in your car or cross the street every day.
There's very little in life that truly has zero risk.
Every day we walk around accepting a certain amount of risk to live our lives.
And luckily, most of us don't go around and think, “I better not cross the street because I could get hit by a bus.”
Most people can think thoughts that allow them to go, such as “I'm going to look both ways, then cross the street” or “I'm going to book with a known airline.”.
CNN: How can parents talk to kids about plane accidents without fostering a phobia? .
Saltz: Your tone is important.
If you sound alarmist, it doesn't even matter what the content is — your child will be alarmed.
If you can't talk about it calmly because you're freaked out, go away (and) return when you're calmer.
Try to keep news and social media from your child.
You understand you're seeing the same event posted over and over again, but for your kid, it feels like the event is happening over and over again.
Say you'll answer any questions the best you can, and that the incident was an incredibly rare one and that millions of safe flights happen all the time.
Reassure them you would not take them on something you're concerned isn't safe.
CNN: How long does overcoming aerophobia take? .
Saltz: It can be different for every person, but some people really do get better in eight or 10 weekly therapy sessions.
Some people's phobia is resistant, so recovery can take longer and be very difficult.
But many people do respond in a shorter time period. .
Therapy may keep the phobia at bay for years or, for some people, permanently.
Others might need to come back in and re-engage in treatment.
It's hard — if you've got a phobia and you think the most terrorizing thing that could possibly happen to you is to be exposed to this thing which makes you terrified, then you have to have a certain amount of faith and trust in the system and belief that this (treatment) can help you.

Title: Asia markets slump as Trump's new trade war rattles global confidence | CNN Business
# Asia markets slump as Trump's new trade war rattles global confidence | CNN Business.
Hong Kong CNN — .
Asia markets slumped on Monday after Donald Trump slapped tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, sparking fears of another bruising 'America First' trade war that could hit global growth.
Japan's Nikkei plunged more than two percent at one point on Monday and Hong Kong's Hang Seng was down more than one percent.
South Korea's KOSPI was down more than two percent at one point.
Shanghai was closed for the Lunar New Year holiday.
China's markets will resume trading on Wednesday.
The US dollar soared to a record high against the Chinese yuan.
“Trump's trade war has started,” Alvin Tan, head of Asia currency strategy at RBC Capital Markets in Singapore told Reuters, noting it was hard to see the dollar retreating any time soon.
Trump announced over the weekend that tariffs will amount to a significant 25% duty on all imports from Mexico and most goods from Canada, and a 10% tariff on Chinese goods imported into the United States.
The tariffs - which Trump says are needed to combat the flow of migrants and fentanyl into the US - are due to come into effect on Tuesday.
Canada and Mexico have announced retaliatory tariffs, and China has said it will challenge the move at the World Trade Organization.
On Sunday evening, Trump also threatened to enact additional tariffs on the European Union — accusing the EU of being “really out of line.”.
Trump later said he plans to speak with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday morning, less than a day before the US' tariffs on the country are scheduled to go into effect.
“The surprise for markets … is that Canada and Mexico retaliated immediately and that others, i.e. China and the EU, may follow their lead, resulting in a sharp contraction in global trade,” Tony Sycamore, a market analyst at IG told Reuters.

Title: In public, they ran a successful global business.

# In public, they ran a successful global business.
In private, police allege they abused hundreds ofchildren | CNN.
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia CNN — .
Millions dined in their restaurants worldwide, getting a taste of Malaysia supplied by a sprawling conglomerate that claimed to embrace Islamic values by caring for thousands of disadvantaged children they said were orphans in homes across the country.
But the leaders of Global Ikhwan Services and Business Holdings (GISBH) are now fighting allegations they ran a cult-like organization that forced followers to work and have many children, some allegedly conceived through rape, to populate orphanages and raise donations that funded their lavish lifestyles.
When Malaysian police raided two dozen homes run by the company in mid-September, they rescued over 600 children and have since detained hundreds of people, charging some with crimes including child trafficking, sexual abuse and organized crime.
GISBH lawyer Rosli Kamaruddin says the group's leaders plan to fight the charges.
In a monthslong investigation CNN spoke to more than a dozen people including former members, their lawyers, and religious scholars to understand how for decades Global Ikhwan, and the alleged abuse they perpetrated, remained Malaysia's best-kept secret.
Former followers told CNN they had no contact with the outside world or access to cellphones and received their only news via an in-house television channel that promoted the teachings of Al Arqam, an Islamic cult that was banned by the Malaysian government in the mid-90s for “deviant” beliefs that strayed far from orthodox teachings.
This is the story of the cult's apparent revival - complete with its own prison islands and “holy water” infused with the leaders' hair and bathwater that former members say was sprayed on goods produced in their factories and on meals served to diners at their restaurants.
CNN has reached out to GISBH for comment on the allegations within this story but is yet to receive a response.
Royal Malaysia Police launched a series of raids in September on dozens of care homes operated by GISBH, and over several weeks rescued hundreds of children they say were the offspring of company employees.
In one press briefing, Police Inspector General Razarudin Husain told reporters children were groomed, malnourished and subject to “child labor, exploitation.”
Health screenings conducted on 392 children found all had suffered physical or emotional abuse.
“They themselves were abused by their caretakers.
Then they were forced to sodomize other children,” Husain told another press briefing.
As the raids unraveled, GISBH restaurants, grocery stores and laundromats were closed, blinds drawn, logos stripped off the walls and social media accounts shut down.
Some of the groups' members fled back to their hometowns across Malaysia and were awaiting instructions from the group's leaders as to what to do next, their families said.
In raids on houses affiliated with GISBH leadership, police found dozens of books and photographs associated with Ashaari Muhammad, the founder of Al Arqam.
Some had been buried in a riverbed, their pages caked in mud.
Al Arqam was an Islamic group - led by Ashaari, known as “Abuya” or Father to his followers - that believed in building a self-sufficient Islamic community with Malaysia at the center of the Muslim world.
It was banned by the Malaysian government in 1994 for “deviant” teachings, a decision that at the time was questioned by international rights groups as a potential breach of religious freedom.
Ashaari subsequently spent 10 years under house arrest and died in 2010.
GISBH's promotional material says the company was founded by Ashaari “with the aim to develop the Islamic way of life in all aspects of life such as education, arts and culture, animal farming.”
Before the raids, GISBH had about 100 care homes housing many of the 3,000 “youths” the group claimed to be their “employees,” according to former members and information from the company's website.
One of Ashaari's daughters, Ummu Atiyah, told CNN the movement had changed since her father's leadership.
“Women are treated with all kinds of abuse … and all the money only goes to the leaders' comfort” she said.
“They have jet skis, motorhomes, vehicles that were not there when my father led the movement.”.
Those arrested include GISBH CEO Nasiruddin Mohd Ali who admitted in a video statement that “one or two cases of sodomy” occurred, but he rejected all other allegations made against the group as slander.
“I am not trying to blame the law.
Indeed, we have done some wrong in the eyes of the law […] Indeed, there were one or two cases of sodomy, but why lump them all together?
” he said.
Nasiruddin, alongside other GISBH leadership, has since been charged with belonging to an organized crime group and is currently awaiting trial.
Among those also charged is Mohammad Adib At-Tarmimi, the son of Ashaari.
The highly publicized case shocked the nation.
While most Malaysians had heard about Abuya and Al Arqam back in the 90s, few knew about their connection to GISBH and the alleged abuses that went on inside the company.
But it came as no surprise to anyone who had ever worked for GISBH.
## Scabies, stitches and secrets .
Farid, who recently left GISBH, was 27 when he joined the group in 2010 after years of struggling with drug addiction.
“I give my soul, I give myself to them because they want to fix me,” said Farid, who asked to use a pseudonym to protect his family.
He was in an arranged marriage with the daughter of a senior member and quickly had two daughters.
When their older daughter turned two, she was sent to live in a charity home, like most GISBH children.
At first glance, some of the welfare homes bear no association to GISBH.
Some carried the GISBH logo, but others appeared to be normal houses with yards strewn with toys on quiet suburban streets.
Facebook pages run by the homes show small children said to be orphans in religious garb, singing and praying, imploring followers to donate or give zakat to buy food, clothes or school supplies.
Zakat is a form of religious alms-giving and one of the five mandatory pillars of Islam.
But the children were not orphans.
In most cases their parents were GISBH workers, like Farid, though some hadn't seen their kids in years.
Instead, they were raised by caretakers who in some cases were only a few years older than them, according to former members and law enforcement.
The days were spent studying Islam and praying, not just to Allah but to Nasiruddin, the chief executive of GISBH and other leaders of the company, Farid, who briefly worked at a boys' care home in the 2010s, told CNN.
The kids were told, “Your mother is nothing, your father is nothing, there is only your leader - Nasiruddin,” he said.
“At night the children sleep with tears [in their eyes].”.
Over time many of the children came to believe they actually were orphans, he added, while authorities said some couldn't identify their parents.
Farid says his daughter quickly changed after moving into a welfare home.
“My daughter was a cheerful girl, always smiling, always laughing but when she went there, she was very sad, she had no self-confidence,” he said.
When he visited his daughter, he said she looked malnourished, her hands covered in scabies - an infection caused by mites that burrow their way under the skin and lay eggs there.
The condition was seen in many children who were rescued from the care homes, according to images shared with CNN.
Amir, another former GISBH worker, told CNN that before he left the group in 2021, he tried to visit his four-year-old son at the care home as often as possible.
Amir, who asked to use a pseudonym to protect his family, said caretakers told him the boy was often crying and wetting his pants.
One time he visited, his son had stitches on his chin and forehead.
Amir said a caretaker had admitted throwing the boy in anger after he wet himself.
The boy also told his father he was locked in a dog kennel as punishment.
“They asked me to keep the matter a secret,” Amir said, but he said almost everyone at the group knew about other instances of abuse that went on in the care homes.
If their child hadn't been hurt, they knew somebody whose kid had been, he said.
The group's headquarters was a sprawling compound complete with horse stables in the town of Rawang, a 30-minute drive from the capital Kuala Lumpur.
One local resident recalled that the arrival of the Al Arqam-linked community in the early 2000s drew attention from locals, but there was an “unspoken boundary” between the group and the rest of the town's residents.
Life inside the community was tightly controlled.
Former followers told CNN they had no contact with the outside world or access to cellphones.
An in-house production company made news-like programming about their leaders that was broadcast on their own television channel called Ikhwan TV.
Programming included prayers, cartoons and live coverage from motorsport and equestrian events organized by the group, according to former members.
“GISBH embodies the criteria of a cult - absolute loyalty to leaders, charismatic leader at the core of the movement; exclusive membership and severe penalty for leaving, members' loss of personal autonomy,” said Dr Azmil Tayeb, a political scientist and associate professor at Universiti Sains Malaysia, who specializes in Islamic political and social movements.
Men and women, even married couples, lived in gender-segregated dorms and were not allowed to meet without the leaders' approval, former members said.
Even if you saw your wife in the courtyard you couldn't speak to her, Farid recalled.
Instead, married couples had to apply for what were essentially conjugal visits, scheduled appointments where couples were expected to have sex, several former members said.
Viagra was provided and in some cases group leaders demanded to know the details the next morning, said Farid.
“I saw myself as a sex slave, I didn't see myself as a wife,” said Zoey, a former member from Singapore, who left the group in 2021 and asked to use a pseudonym to protect her young children.
“The role as a woman in GISB is only for you to give birth.”.
Zoey's family joined GISBH when she was a teenager, and she struggled to adapt to the restrictive culture of the group.
At the age of 17, she was deemed “uncontrollable” by the leadership and married to a man 10 years her senior.
Within weeks of being married, her husband became physically and sexually abusive towards her, she said.
He regularly raped her, she said.
Zoey said she tried to go on birth control pills but when her husband found out, she was beaten again and forced to stop.
Her complaints to the group elders went unheard, she said.
Instead, she was told to obey her husband as “he is your heaven.”.
Zoey fled the marriage and now cares for their nine children in Singapore - the eldest nearly the age she was when she was forced to marry.
Other female members CNN spoke to echoed Zoey's experience of abuse and sexual violence.
Many of them said they were forcibly married as teenagers, others gifted to men as rewards for business successes.
In 2022, the group claimed to have more than 5,000 employees working in restaurants, bakeries, factories and supermarkets and other businesses in 20 countries including Australia, the UK, France, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, where they also ran a resort, according to their website and news reports.
Farid and Amir both recall working from dusk until dawn in Ikhwan factories producing noodles, chili sauce, and other condiments 365 days a year.
Like most GISBH employees, they said they were never paid for their work but were provided food and board.
Sometimes their colleagues were children, they said.
Photos shared with CNN show prepubescent children packaging noodles and operating factory machinery.
The minimum age for full-time work in Malaysia is 15 .
The company's unsettling practices allegedly extended to the food factories where workers sprayed so-called holy water on products sold to the public, according to several former members.
“Holy water” or “Air Berkat” was a concoction made by mixing the leaders' saliva, body hair and bathwater.
Members of the group believed that each part of their leaders' bodies contained “berkat” or spiritual-magical properties.
“I made chili paste, chili sauce and noodles, so I sprayed it [holy water] over them,” one former member told CNN.
These products were then sold to the public in GISBH-owned supermarkets and used in their restaurants across the country, the former members said.
The group's overseas assets were among some of their most prized, despite them never turning profits, according to financial records analyzed by CNN.
One former member told CNN that the overseas assets were a way for the group to gain “popularity” and build influence.
Most former members CNN spoke to had at some point lived and worked abroad, living in company dorms, some while they were only teenagers.
These locations also served as informal meeting places for the company to build relationships with government officials, Tayeb, the political scientist, explained.
“They've always been well connected; we are not talking about an isolated cult in the middle of the jungle,” said Tayeb.
GISBH's connections reached the highest level of Malaysia's elites.
In April 2023, the executive chairman of the group and several other senior leaders met with Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim at his private office.
At the meeting, the prime minister “promised to help all efforts of GISBH in the name of the Muslim economy,” according to an article posted on Ikhwan News, the group's own media publication.
Following the raids in September, Anwar urged police and religious authorities to investigate and take appropriate action to address misconduct at the company.
While some employees worked 16-hour shifts in factories, restaurants and resorts, GISBH leadership spent their time jetting around the world, meeting the highest rungs of Malaysian leadership and attending sporting events, with Nasiruddin taking a special interest in horseback riding and motorsports.
Followers were told not to question the leaders' lavish spending for it was all done in the name of Islam, one former member said.
“They say we buy superbikes for Islam,” said the former member, who wished to remain anonymous.
Anyone who asked questions or dissented was sent to “quarantine,” faraway camps where members spent months living in jungle huts with no water or electricity, repenting their sins, said several former members, recalling their experience.
As one former member put it: “You ask today, tomorrow they send you to the quarantine island.”.
Nearly every single former GISBH member CNN spoke to had at one point been sent to quarantine.
Zoey said she spent nearly half a year in quarantine while pregnant with her second child, where she was forbidden from speaking to anyone and denied medical checkups.
Amir said he spent 10 months in quarantine on Tioman Island, a nature reserve popular with tourists off the main coast of Malaysia.
He said he was sent there as punishment for trying to escape after learning about his son's abuse.
Since the raids in September, most of the children have returned to the care of their parents, but over 100 children are yet to be claimed by their families, authorities said.
A lawyer representing several former members told CNN that in some cases children refuse to go home with parents who left the group because they'd been taught to fear them.
“My children don't love or respect me anymore.
They have been brainwashed,” the lawyer recalled one of his clients telling him.
The years of indoctrination will take some time to undo.
After attending reeducation programs, the GISBH children will eventually be introduced to mainstream schools, according to Malaysia's education ministry.
There, they will for the first time become a part of Malaysian society.
For the adults not facing charges, the future is unclear.
Those who grew up inside the group have few life skills to fall back on, and many of the men have multiple wives and many children they now need to support.
Former members told CNN a sense of security came with living within GISBH.
Their lives were at times lonely and limited, but one day they hoped to reap the rewards of their devotion.
“They say if you are in the group, you are on the highway to Heaven,” Farid said.
Outside, Zoey said, former members “have nowhere to go.”.
On January 9 GISBH posted a message on their Facebook page after months of silence.
“Some people are created to be a test to other people,” it read.
“So be patient with all this.”.

Title: Live updates: Grammys wins for Beyoncé and Kendrick Lamar highlight 2025 show | CNN
# Live updates: Grammys wins for Beyoncé and Kendrick Lamar highlight 2025 show | CNN.
According to the man running it, the Grammys has made some improvements.
Harvey Mason Jr. , chief executive officer of the Recording Academy and MusiCares, took to the stage Sunday night to address what had been a bumpy road for the award show.
“When I took on this role back in 2020, I wanted the organization to change and modernize so we could be better and serve this dynamic and global music community,” Mason said.
“But my early days were not exactly straightforward.
The Academy faced some real criticism for many in our music community.” .
.
One of those critics was acclaimed singer The Weeknd.
Mason said he remembered “waking up to the headlines that the Weeknd called out the Academy for lack of transparency in our awards” adding that the Canadian R&B and pop star “went so far as to announce he was boycotting the Grammys.” .
Since then, Mason said, the Academy has made some changes and “remade our membership, adding more than 3,000 women voting members.”.
“The Grammy electorate is now younger, nearly 40% people of color, and 66% of our members are new,” Mason said.
“Since we started our transformation this year, the 13,000 voting members of the Academy nominated their peers and voted for the winners that you're seeing on this stage tonight.
It's a system rooted in fairness, integrity, and the principle that every voice in our community matters.”.
.
And as proof that times are changing, he welcomed The Weeknd back to the Grammys stage Sunday night.
The Weeknd performed two songs from his new album “Hurry Up Tomorrow,” including “Cry For Me” and “Timeless,” the latter featuring an appearance by rapper Playboi Carti.
It was the first time the singer returned to the Grammys stage since 2021, when he accused the Recording Academy, the group behind the Grammys, for being “corrupt” on his X page after he was shut out of earning any nominations that year for his acclaimed album “After Hours”. .
The Weeknd's return was certainly a statement, with the audience rising to their feet to watch him sing his newest songs from atop a large platform.
Smoke billowed from the stage through laser lights throughout the four-time Grammy-winner's performance.
“Hurry Up Tomorrow” was released on Friday.

Title: DeepSeek chaos suggests 'America First' may not always win | CNN Business
# DeepSeek chaos suggests 'America First' may not always win | CNN Business.
CNN — .
The stunning rise of DeepSeek is sending s hockwaves through the artificial intelligence world , threatening America's dominance that seemed set in stone just a week ago.
The fact that a little-known Chinese startup has built a model that can compete with leading US AI systems is challenging the conventional wisdom that it takes gobs of money and unlimited access to cutting-edge computer chips to train AI technology.
It shouldn't really be possible for a Chinese AI startup to go toe-to-toe with OpenAI's GPT-4o and Google's Gemini.
Now, President Donald Trump has to decide how to respond.
The United States has imposed tough restrictions that are designed to prevent Chinese firms from buying or building their own cutting-edge computer chips required to train AI models.
These chips are at the heart of the AI arms race and the goal of the export curbs is to prevent China from keeping up.
Some have argued that DeepSeek's success - it claims to have trained its new AI model R1 at a fraction of the cost and on far fewer high-end chips than leading AI models - shows the Biden and first Trump administrations' export curbs have backfired: These tough restrictions may have backed Beijing into a corner, forcing Chinese firms to come up with ways to innovate around the export curbs or build their own chips.
“Rather than impeding China, these AI export controls may be accelerating China's AI capacity by pushing them to innovate,” John Villasenor, a professor of engineering and law at UCLA, told CNN in a phone interview.
“The export controls, arguably, are counterproductive.”.
That would be a blow to the tough crackdowns under both Trump and former President Joe Biden - and the ones envisioned during this new Trump administration.
“We accidentally upped their technical game,” AI researcher Gary Marcus wrote in a Substack post .
“It is clear that the game has changed.” .
That notion - that punishing restrictions may have had the opposite effect as the United States intended - is raising tough questions about the very foundation of the AI boom, the tech arms race between the United States and China and how the Trump administration should respond.
Trump may be unswayed.
“I think Trump doubles down,” said Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James, noting that Trump has surrounded himself with China hawks, such as Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
“His advisers around him point to more restrictions, not less.”.
If Trump adds even more pressure on China over AI, proponents of a more hawkish strategy believe China's house of AI cards may crumble.
Skeptics say it's not clear how much of a gamechanger DeepSeek is.
They argue its success could have been made possible either stockpiling high-end chips before restrictions were imposed or by buying the semiconductors on the black market.
“It is either a Sputnik Moment or a Potemkin Moment,” Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management, told CNN in an email.
“It is either truly disruptive or deceptive, relying on hoarded Nvidia chips and others before the export sanction.”.
Sonnenfeld added that if it is a “Sputnik-style disruption, it is a blow to pure reliance on competitive private markets without government partnership and national industrial policies.”.
Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang told CNBC that he understands DeepSeek has 50,000 leading-edge chips that they “can't talk about, obviously, because it is against the export controls that the United States has put in place.”.
Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management, urged investors to take DeepSeek's claims “with a grain of salt” because there is no concrete proof to back them up.
“China is claiming it has come up with the silver bullet, but it could be like the guy in high school who says he has a girlfriend, but she's just at a different school,” Hogan said in a phone interview, noting that there has long been skepticism among Western economists about the veracity of China's economic statistics.
If DeepSeek did have access to leading edge chips, that supports the argument that the export controls should be toughened.
Mills notes that there is a “very active” black market for high-end chips and enforcement of export controls has been uneven.
“This has been a game of whack-a-mole,” Mills said.
“There are still glaring loopholes that need to be closed.”.
For example, Mills pointed to the need for more robust enforcement and further restrictions on the flow of leading-edge computer chips.
Jake Sullivan, the US National Security Adviser under Biden, has acknowledged that the export controls are a work in progress.
“This is an iterative process.
We learn, they learn.
We learn, they learn,” Sullivan said in May during a fireside chat. .
Sullivan also noted that China has tried to overwhelm export controls by projecting an air of inevitability to its AI ambitions.
“The PRC has embarked on a massive and relentless information campaign to basically say, 'This is futile.
Resistance is futile.
We will break these controls,'” Sullivan said.
The stakes are massive.
Many in Washington were well aware that the United States is in an AI arms race.
But that race may be a bit closer, and perhaps significantly cheaper, than previously known.

Beyoncé has won more Grammy Awards than anyone in history, but there was always one big category missing from her trophy case: album of the year.
That changed Sunday night, as her genre-bending “Cowboy Carter” took top honors and gave her that elusive win .
“I just feel full and very, very honored,” Beyoncé said while accepting the award.
“It's been many, many years.”.
Earlier in the night, Beyoncé became the first Black woman in more than 50 years to win a country Grammy when she and Miley Cyrus won the award for best country duo/group performance (“II Most Wanted”).
“Cowboy Carter” also won the Grammy for best country album.
“I think sometimes genre is a cold word to keep us in our place as artists,” Beyoncé said.
“And I just want to encourage people to do what they're passionate about and stay persistent.”.
Rapper Kendrick Lamar was another big winner Sunday night, as “Not Like Us” — the capstone of his feud last year with Drake — won both record of the year and song of the year .
“At the end of the day, (there is) nothing more powerful than rap music,” he said.
I don't care what it is.
We are the culture.
It's going to always stay here forever.”.
Comedian Trevor Noah hosted the event for the fifth straight year.
This year's telecast also focused on raising funds to support relief efforts and aid for music professionals who were impacted by the devastating wildfires in Los Angeles County .
Near the end of the show, Noah said $7 million had already been raised by people watching from home .
Some of the other major winners Sunday included Chappell Roan, who won best new artist; Sabrina Carpenter, who won best pop vocal album ("Short n' Sweet”); and Doechii, who won best rap album (“Alligator Bites Never Heal”)..

Title: 'Mona Lisa' will get its own room under a 10-year renovation of the Louvre in Paris | CNN
# 'Mona Lisa' will get its own room under a 10-year renovation of the Louvre in Paris | CNN.
Paris, France AP — .
French President Emmanuel Macron announced Tuesday that the “Mona Lisa” will get its own dedicated room inside the Louvre museum under a major renovation and expansion of the Paris landmark that will take up to 10 years.
The renovation project, branded “Louvre New Renaissance,” will include a new entrance near the River Seine, to be opened by 2031, and the creation of underground rooms, Macron said in a speech from the Louvre room where Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece is displayed.
Macron did not disclose the cost, estimated to run into hundreds of millions of euros, to modernize the most visited museum in the world , plagued with overcrowding and outdated facilities.
But it is estimated to reach up to 800 million euros ($834 million). .
The Louvre's latest overhaul dates back to the 1980s, when the iconic glass pyramid was unveiled.
Now, the museum is not up to international standards anymore.
A look at what's at stake:.
Macron said the expansion of the museum will allow the “Mona Lisa” to be moved to a new, dedicated room accessible to visitors through a special ticket.
That will make the visit simpler for those who want to see the painting and ease the life of other visitors in the rest of the museum, he said.
The “Mona Lisa” is now being shown behind protective glass in the museum's largest room, overcrowded with long, noisy queues of visitors eager to take a selfie with Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece.
That makes some other paintings in the room by the greatest Venetian painters like Titian and Veronese go unnoticed by many.
The museum's latest big renovation in the 1980s was designed to receive 4 million annual visitors.
Last year, the Louvre received 8.7 million visitors, over three-quarters being foreigners mostly from the United States, China and neighboring countries Italy, the UK, Germany and Spain.
## A costly and complex overhaul .
Macron said a new entrance for the Louvre will be created near the River Seine by 2031, to be financed by ticket sales, patronage and licensing money from the museum's Abu Dhabi branch. .
A design competition is to be staged in the coming months, he said.
In addition, some new underground rooms will be created to expand the museum.
A French top official said the cost of the renovation is estimated at 700 to 800 million euros ($730 to 834 million) over the next ten years, including half for the creation of the new entrance.
The official could not be named in line with the French presidency's customary practices.
Macron said ticket prices will be raised for foreign visitors from outside the European Union, up from 22 euros ($23) now.
He promised the museum will be safer and more comfortable for both the public and the staff.
Half the Louvre's budget is currently being financed by the French state, including the wages of the 2,200 employees.
The other half is provided by private funds including ticket sales, earnings from restaurants, shops and bookings for special events, as well as patrons and other partners.
## Water leaks and other damage .
The renovation announcement comes after Louvre Director Laurence des Cars expressed her concerns in a note to Culture Minister Rachida Dati earlier this month saying the museum is threatened by “obsolescence.”.
According to the document first released by French newspaper Le Parisien, she warned about the gradual degradation of the building due to water leaks, temperature variations and other issues “endangering the preservation of artworks.”.
The pyramid that serves as the museum's entrance, unveiled in 1989 as part of late President François Mitterrand's project, now appears outdated.
The place is not properly insulated from the cold and the heat and tends to amplify noise, making the space uncomfortable for both the public and the staff, des Cars stressed.
In addition, the museum suffers from a lack of food offerings and restroom facilities, she said.

# How a train station tragedy is threatening to bring down a hardline European president | CNN.
CNN — .
On the first day of November, Aleksandar Matkovic was running late for a train.
He was traveling from Novi Sad, in the north of Serbia, to its capital Belgrade, where he works as an economic historian.
When he got to the station, he witnessed a scene of horror that has rocked the country to this day.
Minutes before he arrived, the canopy of the station - where reconstruction had been completed months earlier - had collapsed, crushing passengers waiting on the platform.
Fifteen people were killed.
“I stood there for about two or three hours, just staring blankly at the space where the

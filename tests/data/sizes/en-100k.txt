Title: Americans may find themselves paying the cost of tariffs on imports | CNN Politics
# Americans may find themselves paying the cost of tariffs on imports | CNN Politics.
CNN — .
A day after signing steep new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China, President Donald Trump acknowledged what economists, members of Congress and even some of his own aides — in their previous lives — have been saying all along: Americans may find themselves paying the costs .
“THIS WILL BE THE GOLDEN AGE OF AMERICA!
WILL THERE BE SOME PAIN?
YES, MAYBE (AND MAYBE NOT!),” Trump posted, in all capital letters, on his Truth Social platform.
The message, which appeared in the hour before Trump arrived to his West Palm Beach, Florida, golf club for the second day in a row, amounted to an advance warning.
Trump is serious about fulfilling his campaign promises to end illegal immigration, curb the flow of deadly drugs and rebalance continental trade.
But doing so will be uncomfortable, Trump is suggesting, and could serve to undermine another of his top campaign vows: lowering costs for Americans.
“WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AND IT WILL ALL BE WORTH THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID,” Trump wrote.
“WE ARE A COUNTRY THAT IS NOW BEING RUN WITH COMMON SENSE — AND THE RESULTS WILL BE SPECTACULAR!!!”.
Instead of the new trade war lowering grocery or fuel prices, Trump on Sunday pointed to a result he never mentioned when he was running for president: annexing Canada as an American state.
“Canada should become our Cherished 51st State.
Much lower taxes, and far better military protection for the people of Canada — AND NO TARIFFS!
” he said, repeating an idea he's floated repeatedly since winning the election late last year.
As industries brace for the new tariffs — 25% on goods from Mexico and Canada, and 10% on imports from China — it remains to be seen how long it will take for higher costs to have an impact on American consumers.
The tariffs are set to go into effect Tuesday at 12:01 a.m. ET.
In a tacit acknowledgement that upside pressures could affect Americans' gas and heating costs, Trump levied only a 10% tariff on Canadian oil and gas.
Already, Canada and Mexico have moved to retaliate — reluctantly, in the case of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who said during a somber address from Ottawa late Saturday: “We don't want to be here.”.
Canada's former finance minister Chrystia Freeland, who is running to replace Trudeau as prime minister, said her country would rather not get into a trade war with the US but is determined to stand up for itself.
“We don't want to have this fight, but we are not going to lose it,” she told CNN's Fareed Zakaria on Sunday, calling it a “lose-lose” situation that will end up hurting Americans, since they depend on Canada for many basic goods.
If the back-and-forth tariffs remain in place for a prolonged period, the “pain” Trump warned of could become a reality.
Sen. Tim Kaine argued Sunday on “State of the Union” that Americans will see increased prices at the pump within days and that American businesses will be harmed once the other nations' retaliatory tariffs kick in.
“I'm struck by the irony.
Last week, the president signed an emergency order regarding energy.
There's an energy emergency.
And he just put a 10% tariff on energy from Canada?
” the Virginia Democrat told CNN's Jake Tapper, adding, “The emergency is self-created.”.
Democratic Gov.
Andy Beshear of Kentucky, which Trump won by more than 30 percentage points in the 2024 election, warned of the potential impacts on the state's bourbon industry after the provinces of British Columbia and Ontario directed their liquor boards to remove American alcohol from shelves.
But even some Trump allies have privately hoped that after implementing the harsh new duties — and proving to the world he's willing to act decisively — Trump could eventually ease up, as long as he's extracted some concessions.
Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, told “Fox News Sunday” that the tariffs “are designed to bring about change.
And if the change comes, I think the tariffs probably go away.”.
What exactly those concessions might be, however, isn't clear.
Before implementing the tariffs, Trump did not meet or speak on the telephone with Trudeau or with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum to spell out his demands.
Trudeau said Saturday he'd been trying to reach Trump since the inauguration, but his calls have not been returned.
Briefing reporters Saturday evening, White House officials declined to lay out specific benchmarks that Canada or Mexico could reach in tightening their borders or curbing fentanyl flows that would allow the tariffs to be lifted.
And Trump himself told reporters late Friday he wasn't looking for any concessions at all.
In his social media posting Sunday morning, his rationale for the tariffs extended well beyond punishment for the illicit flow of fentanyl.
“The USA has major deficits with Canada, Mexico, and China (and almost all countries!), owes 36 Trillion Dollars, and we're not going to be the 'Stupid Country' any longer,” he wrote.
“MAKE YOUR PRODUCT IN THE USA AND THERE ARE NO TARIFFS!”.

Title: Inside the grueling effort to recover the bodies of all 67 victims from the mangled wreckage of DC plane collision | CNN
# Inside the grueling effort to recover the bodies of all 67 victims from the mangled wreckage of DC plane collision | CNN.
CNN — .
Families were waiting at the airport to welcome home loved ones when their plane, just minutes from landing, collided midair with a military helicopter in a fiery explosion, plunging 67 lives full of promise into the cold, inky waters of the Potomac River.
The frantic search for survivors started under the cloak of icy darkness.
By morning, the mission had turned into a slow and somber search for the remains of everyone on board.
As of Sunday afternoon, 55 bodies have been identified, DC Fire and EMS Chief John Donnelly said, with the search effort hampered by near-zero visibility in the frigid water , sharp pieces of debris and the mangled metal of the wreckage.
Amid heated political speculation on the cause of Wednesday night's collision and grief-stricken stories from heartbroken loved ones, hundreds of rescue personnel continue to search relentlessly for the remains of every person lost.
“They're getting home and they're crashing and falling into really deep sleeps, and then getting up and going back to work and doing it again,” David Hoagland, president of the Washington, DC, Firefighters Local 36, told CNN.
“However long it takes, they're going to be there.”.
Days later, dangerous and difficult conditions persist, hindering the careful and deliberate efforts of crews working to recover the bodies of victims trapped deep within the wreckage, beyond the reach of divers.
The recovery effort has been extensive, involving nearly every dive team in the area, including the US Coast Guard, the FBI's Washington Field Office dive team, DC Fire and the International Association of Fire Fighters.
Here's how their efforts are unfolding.
## Heavier equipment needed to remove remaining bodies .
The mangled wreckage in the Potomac River has made the recovery effort especially difficult for dive teams, who have struggled to access parts of the plane's fuselage.
These sections will need to be removed to retrieve the remaining bodies, Donnelly said.
“Things have kind of slowed down this weekend because they're waiting on a lot more heavier salvage equipment that's going to be showing up sometime in the next 24 to 36 hours,” Hoagland told CNN on Saturday.
“They're going to be setting up for a pretty complicated operation where they're going to be removing plane parts from the water on Monday.”.
The wreckage of the American Airlines jet broke apart, according to Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy.
The fuselage was found upside down in three sections in the river, which is about 8 feet deep in some areas.
Divers have been using specialized underwater hydraulic rescue tools capable of cutting metal to try to recover as many victims as possible, Hoagland said.
Asked whether authorities are confident about the location of the remaining bodies, Donnelly said, “We think we know where they are,” but “we won't know until we're done.”.
“I believe that when we remove the aircraft, that that will help us resolve this number,” he said.
“If it doesn't, we will continue the search.”.
The Army Corps of Engineers will start working to remove the remnants of the jet Monday, according to a news release .
Then, engineers will switch their focus to the remnants of the Black Hawk helicopter involved in the collision.
They expect to finish removing the wreckage by February 12, the release says.
A US Coast Guard boat equipped with a crane was used Friday to hold the door of the US Army Black Hawk helicopter, allowing for the retrieval of the bodies of all three service members, followed by the “dignified transfer of their remains,” Hoagland said.
The wreckage of the helicopter was located about 300 yards from the plane debris, according to Hoagland.
Most of Friday's recovery operations focused on the Black Hawk.
Recovery teams are planning to bring a larger crane to the Potomac crash site to help reach victims in a section of the wreckage divers can't access, a law enforcement source told CNN.
The crane, used to remove parts of the Francis Scott Key Bridge after its collapse last March, will be employed to cut and lift pieces of the airplane.
This will allow divers to safely recover additional victims who are pinned inside and extremely difficult to access.
“With these really large marine salvage cranes and vessels, as you can imagine, these things are not very seaworthy,” Hoagland said.
“They can't move very fast because they've got giant cranes on them, so it's slow sail to get up the bay and then into the river to get up to DC.”.
Rescue teams are also on the water using technology such as sonar scanning to continue their search and deploy divers.
Additionally, crews will search sewer lines and conduct aerial operations as dive teams work in targeted areas, according to Donnelly.
## Dangerous, difficult and risky conditions .
When a direct line to Reagan National Airport rang Wednesday night, Hoagland said, Local 36 first responders expected a routine report of a flight in distress.
Instead, they heard: “Crash!
Crash!
Crash!
” he recalled.
As union members rushed to a pier to board a fireboat, burning debris rained down on Potomac.
First responders arrived to find wreckage submerged in the shallow water and almost immediately started finding victims, Hoagland said.
Some passengers were still strapped to their seats, but removing them proved difficult as sharp pieces of debris tore the wetsuits worn by first responders.
“They had a lot working against them.
They had the current in the river.
They had jet fuel all over in the water with them.
They had debris.
They had ice,” Edward Kelly, general president of the International Association of Fire Fighters, told CNN on Thursday. “
Like I said, the swift current was a challenge, searching the fuselage - there's a lot of sharp objects in the cockpit - so it was a very difficult and risky and dangerous rescue attempt.”.
At one point, there were close to 50 divers in the water responding to the incident, he said.
“One thing that was a blessing was the civilian dinner boat in DC did a trip up the Potomac yesterday, which actually broke the ice that allowed the smaller boats to respond to the actual crash last night,” he said.
On the night of the crash, emergency crews battled icy, choppy waters, Donnelly said . .
“The water is dark, it is murky, and that is a very tough condition for them to dive in.
If you can imagine, the river is a large black spot at night with no lights on it, except for a few buoy lights,” Donnelly said.
Friday, search crews continued to exercise caution as weather conditions posed challenges for recovery efforts, Donnelly said.
Divers faced intense mud and near-zero visibility, despite the aircraft resting in only a few feet of water.
“That's actually part of the challenge, is that you're half swimming, half walking while you're working.
This is very strenuous for our divers or rescue swimmers that are in the water,” Donnelly said, referring to the silt at the bottom.
Saturday, calmer weather — with sunshine and fewer winds — helped with visibility, but ice and debris remained critical hazards, Hoagland told CNN.
He added officials are still in the process of mapping the debris field.
“Now that it's a recovery operation, it's much more important to preserve evidence so they can investigate the crash, so they're going to go about it systematically, methodically and intentionally,” Hoagland said.
“They're doing a good job of cataloging and mapping everything by sonar and figuring out where everything is, but it's a tedious, long effort.”.
With the operation shifted from a rescue to a recovery mission, responders are adopting an approach that prioritizes safety, according to Kelly.
For instance, responders will not perform dangerous night dives.
First responders and emergency personnel, who have been working around the clock for days — first desperately searching for survivors, and now recovering remains — are exhausted, Hoagland said, but remain resilient.
“Everybody just really wants to see things through,” Hoagland told CNN.
“We're looking out for each other, and everybody's getting breaks.”.
Recovering the bodies and remains of the victims, especially the children, has been both harrowing and exhausting, Hoagland said, a process that will likely leave a lasting emotional and mental impact on first responders.
To support first responders dealing with the trauma of what they're witnessing on the scene, the International Association of Fire Fighters has deployed teams of former firefighters trained as mental health counselors to assist with ongoing recovery efforts.
“If somebody's really just having a tough time and they need to hit the pause button, they can talk to them and help them decompress and process all the trauma they might be experiencing,” Hoagland said.
There are enough teams on the ground for everyone to provide each other with peer support and take someone's place if they are overwhelmed and need a break, Hoagland said.
Donnelly also emphasized the importance of making sure personnel “understand that the feelings they have are normal and how to get help if there's any feelings that aren't going away, the signs and symptoms, if you're having trouble sleeping, if you aren't eating well, we don't want you to drink, we don't want you arguing with your family,” he said in a news conference Sunday.
The US Coast Guard has Critical Incident Stress Management therapists and chaplains who are waiting for US Coast Guard crews to return to home base and will provide them with mental health support immediately, the agency's Capt. Patrick Burkett said at the news conference.
“This is not normal, and it's OK for them to not feel OK,” Burkett said.
“This is a tragedy,” Donnelly said.
“We are in a business where we deal with the loss of life or people being hurt and one person is bad, and it's hard — and 67 is a lot.”.
The National Transportation Safety Board will allow first responders to complete their work before beginning its investigation into the collision, the board's chair said Thursday.
NTSB Chair Jennifer L. Homendy described it as an “all-hands-on-deck event.”
The NTSB had a full crew on the scene Thursday, with about 50 people at the crash site and additional personnel at the agency's headquarters and labs across the country ready to assist.
But first, “we allow the responders to do their important safety mission, which in this case was search and rescue and recovery,” she said.
“We stand back to allow them to do their important safety mission.”.
Homendy emphasized the NTSB will “leave no stone unturned in this investigation” and that it will be a “whole-of-government effort.”.

Title: Luka Doncic breaks silence following trade from Dallas Mavericks: 'I wanted so badly to bring you a championship' | CNN
# Luka Doncic breaks silence following trade from Dallas Mavericks: 'I wanted so badly to bring you a championship' | CNN.
CNN — .
In his first comments since being traded to the Los Angeles Lakers earlier Sunday, NBA superstar Luka Doncic penned a thank you letter to the Dallas Mavericks, their fans and the city of Dallas.
“Seven years ago, I came here as a teenager to pursue my dream of playing basketball at the highest level,” Doncic wrote in a post on X. “I thought I'd spend my career here and I wanted so badly to bring you a championship.
The love and support you all have given me is more than I could have ever dreamed of.
For a young kid from Slovenia coming to the U.S. for the first time, you made North Texas feel like home.” .
In one of the most stunning trades in league history, the Lakers acquired Doncic, as well as Maxi Kleber, Markieff Morris from the Dallas Mavericks for Anthony Davis, Max Christie and the Lakers' 2029 first-round draft pick.
ESPN's Shams Charania first broke the news of the blockbuster trade on Saturday, citing sources.
“In good times and bad, from injuries to the NBA Finals, your support never changed,” Doncic continued.
“Thank you not only for sharing my joy in our best moments, but also for lifting me up when I needed it most.”.
Doncic, 25, is currently out with a calf injury but has averaged 28.1 points, 8.3 rebounds and 7.8 assists per game in 22 games with the Mavericks this season.
Doncic added: “To all the organizations I've worked with throughout the Dallas community, thank you for letting me contribute to your important work and join you in bringing light to those who need it.
As I start the next part of my basketball journey, I am leaving a city that will always feel like a home away from home.”.
A part of the three-team deal, the Utah Jazz are acquiring Jalen Hood-Schifino, a 2025 Los Angeles Clippers second-round draft pick, and a 2025 Mavericks second-round pick to round out the trade.
The five-time All-Star said he was “grateful” for the opportunity to play in Los Angeles alongside LeBron James.
“Basketball means everything to me, and no matter where I play the game, I'll do so with the same joy, passion and goal - to win championships.,” Doncic said.
Per ESPN's Tim MacMahon, the Mavericks had “major concerns” with Doncic's conditioning and impending potential supermax contract extension.
Even with those concerns going public, it's still a shocking decision by the organization - Doncic was on the All-NBA Team for the last five years and made five consecutive All Star teams before this season when he's been limited by injury.
“Dallas is a special place, and Mavs fans are special fans.
Thank you, from the bottom of my heart,” Doncic posted .
While there is no timetable for Doncic's return to the court, the Lakers are next scheduled to play on Tuesday against crosstown rivals Los Angeles Clippers at the Intuit Dome.

Title: A trans National Guard pilot was falsely accused of flying the helicopter in the fatal plane collision | CNN Business
# A trans National Guard pilot was falsely accused of flying the helicopter in the fatal plane collision | CNN Business.
CNN — .
A trans member of the National Guard is speaking out after a wave of claims on social media falsely pointed to her as the pilot of the Black Hawk helicopter that collided with a passenger jet in Washington, Wednesday, killing 67 people.
Jo Ellis, a UH60 Black Hawk helicopter pilot for the Virginia Army National Guard, posted on Facebook Friday to dispel the rumors that had echoed President Donald Trump's unsubstantiated blaming of diversity initiatives for the fatal accident.
“Some craziness has happened on the internet and I'm being named as one of the pilots of the DC crash,” Ellis wrote.
“It's insulting to the victims and families of those lost and they deserve better than this BS from the bots and trolls of the internet.”.
In her Facebook post, Ellis shared a screenshot of two X posts that linked her being trans to the catastrophic crash, with one user saying they “wouldn't be surprised” if “the pilot was trans” in response to another post that claimed Ellis “has been making radicalized anti-Trump statements on socials.
The latter account has since deleted the post and published an apology .
A separate account, which has a blue checkmark and 13,600 followers, shared a now-deleted post directly attacking Ellis and spreading the bogus conspiracy theory.
While the account has likewise issued a correction , the post still raked in at least 195,000 views and was reshared almost 1,000 times before being deleted.
At the time of both corrections, “Jo Ellis” was the No. 3 trending topic on X, with 19,400 posts.
And, despite Ellis' correction — which she further addressed in a follow-up Facebook video , captioned “proof of life” — far-right accounts on X have continued to spread misinformation and hate speech.
Ellis' erroneous scapegoating in far-right circles follows the ﻿guardswoman's publicized sit-down with CNN's Michael Smerconish, slated to appear in Saturday's episode of “The Smerconish Podcast” during which she discussed her service and experiences with gender dysphoria.
In an essay for Smerconish's newsletter , Ellis also discussed her story, writing about transitioning while serving in the military.
Hate speech following the crash echoed recent attacks from Trump on DEI initiatives and executive actions targeting transgender Americans.
Since returning to the Oval Office, Trump has repeatedly taken aim at transgender people, saying in his inauguration speech “that there are only two genders: male and female.”
Amid his flurry of executive orders, Trump has also re-banned transgender Americans from serving in the military , reviving his 2017 order that was repealed by then-President Joe Biden in 2021 .
And, in his first White House briefing room address , Trump directly linked the crash to DEI while also blaming initiatives from Democrats.
“We must have only the highest standards for those who work in our aviation system,” Trump said.
“I changed the Obama standards from very mediocre at best to extraordinary, you remember that.”.
“Only the highest aptitude, they have to be the highest intellect and psychologically superior people, were allowed to qualify for air traffic controllers,” he said.
In a Thursday White House memo , Trump blamed the Obama administration's implementation of “a biographical questionnaire at the FAA to shift the hiring focus away from objective aptitude,” further linking the crash to DEI initiatives.
“The Biden Administration egregiously rejected merit-based hiring, requiring all executive departments and agencies to implement dangerous 'diversity equity and inclusion' tactics, and specifically recruiting individuals with “severe intellectual” disabilities in the FAA,” Trump wrote in the memo.
Neither the memo nor Trump's press conference provided any evidence to support his brazen claims.
When one reporter pressed the president for an explanation of his diversity claims during the press conference, Trump again failed to provide evidence, responding simply: “Because common sense and unfortunately a lot of people don't.”.
Baseless DEI attacks have become one of the key pillars of the president's MAGA platform, and Trump is far from alone in linking disasters to diversity initiatives.
When disastrous wildfires erupted in California, Elon Musk used his X pulpit to claim “DEI means people DIE,” while others took aim at Karen Bass , the first woman and second black person to serve as Los Angeles mayor.
Conservatives likewise blamed Kristin Crowley , the city's first woman and openly gay fire chief, for the wildfires that killed 28 people.
Other incidents have also been linked to DEI initiatives.
Rep. Dan Meuser told Fox News that the New Orleans' New Years Day tragedy was because “the priority of the last four years has been DEI, not IEDs.”
And Phil Lyman , the one-time Maryland gubernatorial hopeful, blamed the Baltimore Key Brdieg disaster on “governors who prioritize diversity.” .

# UK to target AI child sex abuse tools in world first legal crackdown | CNN.
London Reuters — .
Britain will make it illegal to use artificial intelligence tools that create child sexual abuse images, it said on Saturday, becoming the first country in the world to introduce the new AI sexual abuse offenses.
Possessing, taking, making, showing or distributing explicit images of children is a crime in England and Wales.
The new offenses target the use of AI tools to “nudeify” real-life images of children.
The move comes as online criminals increasingly use AI to create child abuse material, with reports of such explicit images rising nearly five-fold in 2024, according to the Internet Watch Foundation.
“We know that sick predators' activities online often lead to them carrying out the most horrific abuse in person,” said Yvette Cooper, the United Kingdom's interior minister.
“It is vital that we tackle child sexual abuse online as well as offline so we can better protect the public from new and emerging crimes.”.
Predators also use AI tools to disguise their identity and blackmail children with fake images to force them into further abuse, such as by streaming live images, the government said.
The new criminal offenses include the possession, creation or distribution of AI tools designed to create child sexual abuse material and the possession of so-called AI “pedophile manuals,” which provide instructions on the usage of the technology.
Another specific offense will target those who run websites on which child sexual abuse content is distributed.
The government will also enable authorities to unlock digital devices for inspection.
The measures will be included in the Crime and Policing Bill when it comes to parliament.
Britain said earlier this month it would also make the creation and sharing of sexually explicit “deepfakes” - videos, pictures or audio clips made with AI to look real - a criminal offense.

Title: Karla Sofía Gascón says she will not withdraw from Oscar contention over past comments: 'I have not committed any crime' | CNN
# Karla Sofía Gascón says she will not withdraw from Oscar contention over past comments: 'I have not committed any crime' | CNN.
CNN — .
Oscar nominee Karla Sofía Gascón, the star of “Emilia Pérez,” is staying in the race for best actress despite controversy over offensive social media posts .
In an interview with CNN's Juan Carlos Arciniegas, Gascón, who made history last month as the first openly transgender actress nominated for an Oscar in an acting category, once again offered her “most sincere apologies to all the people who may have felt offended.”.
“I cannot step down from an Oscar nomination because I have not committed any crime nor have I harmed anyone.
I am neither racist nor anything that all these people have tried to make others believe I am,” Gascón told CNN.
The controversy arose after journalist Sarah Hagi shared screenshots of Gascón's old social media posts, in which she was critical of Muslim culture, the death of George Floyd and the direction of the Oscars.
Gascón, who deactivated her account on X following the controversy, apologized this week for her posts.
“I want to address the conversation around my past social media posts that have caused harm,” Gascón said in a statement shared with CNN.
“As a member of a marginalized community, I know this suffering all too well and deeply regret having caused pain.
All my life I have fought for a better world.
I believe that light will always triumph over darkness.”.
In one of the posts, originally written in Spanish, Gascón commented on the Floyd case, who died in 2020 after an encounter with police in Minneapolis.
“I really believe that very few ever cared about George Floyd, a scammer drug addict,” she wrote in part.
The actress also criticized the 2021 Oscars ceremony, held amid the Covid-19 pandemic.
“The #Oscars are increasingly resembling an independent and vindicative film awards ceremony, I didn't know if I was watching an Afro-Korean festival, a Black Lives Matter demonstration, or March 8th,” she posted at the time.
In her interview with CNN, Gascón said she didn't “recognize” some of the posts that have resurfaced.
“I have been judged, condemned, sacrificed, crucified, and stoned without a trial and without the option to defend myself,” Gascón said.
She denied writing a since-deleted 2022 tweet in which Selena Gomez, her co-star in “Emilia Pérez,” was described derogatorily.
“It's not mine, of course, I have never said anything about my colleague, I would never refer to her that way,” Gascón said.
Gascón is nominated for an Oscar for best actress for her role in “Emilia Pérez,” a Netflix musical and crime drama that tells the story of a Mexican drug trafficker seeking gender reassignment surgery, which has also generated much controversy, especially in Mexico.
Jacques Audiard, the French director of “Emilia Pérez,” defended the film in an interview with CNN en Español in January, saying, “If there are things that seem scandalous to Mexicans in 'Emilia,' I apologize.” .

# Best red carpet looks at the 2025 Grammys | CNN.
CNN — .
The Grammy Awards are renowned for outlandish fashion.
But on a night of tributes to first responders and victims of LA's recent wildfires, many guests struck a comparatively restrained note at the Crypto.com arena on Sunday.
The all-black trend seen at recent award ceremonies was embraced by everyone from Miley Cyrus (in a cut-out leather Saint Laurent dress) to Olivia Rodrigo (in a slinky halter neck Versace number).
Lady Gaga set a somber tone in a dramatic long-sleeved ball gown by Vivienne Westwood, though some attendees took a more light-hearted approach, whether it was J Balvin's long silk Dior Men coat or the sailor hat Billie Eilish wore with her Prada suit.
Guests also showed their support for LA — which has hosted the Grammys more times than any other city in its 66-year history — by wearing blue heart pins.
Brittany Howard, Jaden Smith and Jacob Collier were among those seen sporting the pins in support of MusiCares, a charity raising money for music industry professionals impacted by the fires.
Elsewhere, several of the evening's most anticipated arrivals used feathers to add volume or definition to their outfits.
Sabrina Carpenter wowed in a custom JW Anderson gown with elegant accents, while the beads and sequins of Cardi B's Roberto Cavalli Couture mermaid gown turned into an autumnal plume as it trailed to the floor.
Meanwhile, Charli XCX and Chappell Roan, who were among the night's most nominated artists, achieved similarly eye-catching effects with ruffles and cascading tulle.
It was perhaps no surprise that both gowns were by the same designer, Jean Paul Gaultier, albeit from very different eras: Charli XCX's outfit was a custom look from the Spring-Summer 2025 runway, while Roan opted for an archive piece from Gaultier's Spring 2003 couture collection.
And this wouldn't be the Grammy's without a bit of skin — or the illusion of it.
The various takes on nude ranged from the subtle (see Madison Beer's divine strapless gown and the sheer detailing of Shakira's Etro dress) to the not-so-subtle.
Ye's wife Bianca Censori left little to the imagination, shocking onlookers by dropping her coat to reveal a see-through slip dress that was, in every sense, barely there.
See below for some of the event's best and boldest looks.
This story will be updated throughout the evening.

Title: Education Department employees placed on paid leave as part of Trump administration's DEI purge | CNN Politics
# Education Department employees placed on paid leave as part of Trump administration's DEI purge | CNN Politics.
CNN — .
Dozens of employees at the Education Department were placed on paid administrative leave Friday as part of the Trump administration's larger effort to rid the federal workforce of employees associated with diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility efforts, two sources familiar with the move told CNN.
The department sent letters to employees informing them that their email accounts were being suspended but that they would continue to receive paychecks for an indefinite period, the sources said.
The department cited guidance from the White House's Office of Personnel and Management, issued on January 21, that directed government agencies to notify “all employees of DEIA offices that they are being placed on paid administrative leave effective immediately as the agency takes steps to close/end all DEIA initiatives, offices and programs.” .
The agency is the latest to face upheaval amid the White House's efforts to weed out DEI programs within the government and reshape the federal workforce in President Donald Trump's image.
At least 55 Education Department employees, including senior-level career workers who have served at the agency for decades, were notified Friday night that they'd been placed on paid leave, according to the American Federation of Government Employees, the union representing the agency's career officials.
“Effective January 31, 2025, you will be placed on administrative leave with full pay and benefits pursuant to the President's executive order on DEIA and further guidance from OPM,” the letter says, according to a copy obtained by CNN.
“This administrative leave is not being done for any disciplinary purpose.”.
According to the union, these employees do not hold job titles nor official duties related to DEIA, but they included staffers such as civil rights attorneys who handle student discrimination and antisemitism complaints; an employee working in a grant office; and a member of the artificial intelligence team helping the department understand AI in education.
But Sheria Smith, union president for Department of Education career employees, told CNN the employees placed on paid leave had attended a two-day diversity training seminar in 2019 during the first Trump administration “that was required for senior-level employees and strongly encouraged for others,” as well as similar training under the Biden administration.
Others affected had either participated in a one-day lunch training on DEI or had volunteered with an agency group or committee that plans programs such as Black History Month celebrations.
The diversity training for Education Department employees was encouraged during the first Trump administration under then-Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, whose goal was for 400 employees to attend the sessions, according to the union.
Because of the large participation in the 2019 training seminar, the union is worried that hundreds more Department of Education staffers could be affected.
“We've filed several requests for information with the agency to get a clear understanding of what's happening and how many employees overall will be impacted,” Smith told CNN, but the union has not received any additional information.
CNN reached out to the Department of Education for comment but did not receive a response.
The New York Times first reported on the letters sent to Education Department employees informing them that they were being put on paid administrative leave.
The White House last month ordered government DEI employees to be placed on administrative leave and ended the use of DEI in hiring and federal contracting.
“The mission of the agency is stalled because this administration has forced these people to stop performing work for the American people,” Smith told CNN.
Agency leaders were also instructed to ask employees to report any efforts to “disguise these programs” in federal jobs and contract descriptions since the November election.

New York CNN — .
The DeepSeek drama may have been briefly eclipsed by, you know, everything in Washington (which, if you can believe it, got even crazier Wednesday).
But rest assured that over in Silicon Valley , there has been nonstop, Olympic-level pearl-clutching over this Chinese upstart that managed to singlehandedly wipe out hundreds of billions of dollars in market cap in just a few hours and put America's mighty tech titans on their heels.
ICYMI: DeepSeek is a Chinese AI lab with a model that's similar to ChatGPT, and people are freaking out over it because of its engineers' claims about how they built it — cheaply, using a small fraction of the computing power used by US labs like OpenAI.
Big picture: DeepSeek has forced tech bros and their investors to question the industry's core assumption that they need gajillions more dollars to effectively secure enough energy to power their AI advancements.
Now, perhaps not unexpectedly, American tech leaders are trying to shift the narrative to make DeepSeek look like the villain. (And you gotta suspect none of these guys — they're mostly guys — paid attention in English class because they appear fully unaware of the excruciating irony — some might say hypocrisy — baked into their accusations.) .
On Tuesday, Bloomberg and the Financial Times reported that OpenAI and Microsoft, its biggest investor, are looking into evidence that DeepSeek used OpenAI's intellectual property to build its competitor, violating its terms of service.
An OpenAI spokesperson confirmed to CNN on Wednesday that the company is “aware of and reviewing indications that DeepSeek may have inappropriately distilled our models, and will share information as we know more.” .
“Distilling” isn't exactly stealing , but it is a kind of copycat maneuver used by developers to train smaller AI models on the performance of larger, more sophisticated ones. (More on that in a moment.) .
CNN One Thing Trump's 'America First' Agenda Meets China's AI Advancement Wall Steet, Washington, and Silicon Valley are scrambling after a little-known Chinese startup claimed its artificial intelligence model can operate like ChatGPT at just a fraction of the cost.
We examine why the breakthrough could reverberate beyond the tech sector as President Donald Trump looks to counter China's influence.

...
So, to recap: OpenAI, a startup that's built on a foundation of data it scraped from the internet without permission , is pointing the finger at another startup allegedly doing… more or less the same thing.
As a reminder, OpenAI is currently mired in litigation with various content creators, including the New York Times , who accuse the company of training its large language models on copyrighted material. (OpenAI doesn't deny using the material but has argued that it's not copyright infringement because the content falls under the legal doctrine known as “fair use.”) .
The irony might have been best summed up in a headline from tech news site 404 Media: “OpenAI Furious DeepSeek Might Have Stolen All the Data OpenAI Stole From Us.” .
Some prominent tech figures greeted the allegations from OpenAI with a shrug, noting that distilling is practically standard practice in the AI industry.
“I'd be surprised if DeepSeek hadn't used it,” said Lutz Finger, senior visiting lecturer at Cornell University.
“Technically, it's easy to do,” he added, and “if done well, it is easy to disguise and avoid detection, thus I would be equally surprised if we ever get proof of such tactics.”.
Tech venture capitalist Bill Gurley wrote on X that “the core algorithm everyone uses was developed at DeepMind,” Google's AI lab.
“No one disputes that.
The vast majority of LLM insights and breakthroughs are 'borrowed.'
”.
So yeah, maybe OpenAI is having a bit of a sour grapes moment over a foreign rival making it look bad on the global stage.
Whatever.
The more generous read is that OpenAI, as the poster child of American AI innovation, is trying to establish some rules in what is an unregulated and rapidly expanding industry that few people outside of it understand at a technical level.
For example, there is a fine line between “distillation” and “extraction,” explains Zack Kass, an AI consultant and former OpenAI go-to-market lead.
“Distillation is a common practice in AI, but it's typically done within the same organization that owns both models,” he said in an email.
“If DeepSeek trained its model by querying ChatGPT at scale and using the responses to teach its own model, it raises legitimate concerns about whether that constitutes unauthorized use of OpenAI's API,” Kass said.
“Regardless of the specifics here, we're entering a phase where the AI community will have to define clearer norms around what constitutes fair use versus unauthorized replication.”.

CNN — .
Like most of us, Earth has a lot going on under the surface — even in what may have once seemed to be its most unassuming layer.
The mantle, a zone between our planet's thin crust and the molten core, features 1,800 miles (2,900 kilometers) of mostly solid rock, with a consistency like thickened caramel that scientists long hypothesized was uniformly blended.
But massive unmixed regions have been found lingering in the mantle, like lumps of chocolate in a cookie, and new findings are just beginning to reveal their secrets.
Among the enigmatic mantle lumps are two enormous “supercontinents” buried thousands of kilometers below the crust amid the remains of ancient tectonic plates.
One supercontinent lies under Africa, and the other resides deep under the Pacific Ocean.
Using a new method to analyze data from earthquakes, researchers recently uncovered previously unknown details about these vast island regions, revealing that they may serve as anchors in our planet's mantle and that they could be much older than previously thought.
The discovery adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that the rocky mantle isn't as well-stirred by Earth's internal churning as once believed.
And hidden structures or pockets of unblended material, such as these supercontinents, may shape mantle activity, including plate movement, in ways that are yet to be understood, scientists reported January 22 in the journal Nature .
“These findings will contribute to a better understanding of mantle convection and plate tectonics, and, therefore, phenomena we experience at the surface like earthquakes and volcanism,” said Claire Richardson , a doctoral candidate in the School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University, who was not involved in the new research.
“Resolving the physical, thermal, and chemical properties of rocks ~3000 km (1,864 miles) below our feet, at extreme temperatures and pressures, is a challenging problem to say the least,” Richardson told CNN in an email.
“Open questions abound, and each new study gets us closer to understanding what's really going on down there.”.
Researchers first spotted the subterranean supercontinents about 50 years ago when they popped up as anomalies in seismic data generated by earthquakes powerful enough to send reverberations through the planet.
When seismic waves encounter unusual structures in the mantle, changes in wave speed provide seismologists with clues about Earth's deep interior.
Over the decades, seismic data revealed that these supercontinents make up about 20% of the mantle-core boundary.
Each of the buried islands covers hundreds of thousands of miles, and in some spots they tower nearly 600 miles (965 kilometers) tall.
However, little was known about what they were made of, when they sank and what role they might play in mantle flow, known as convection, said Dr. Sujania Talavera-Soza , lead author of the new study and a geosciences and seismology researcher at Utrecht University in the Netherlands.
“Their origin and whether they are long-lived structures — it's widely debated,” Talavera-Soza said.
Earlier research focused on the velocity of seismic waves, showing that wave speed slowed by about 2% upon arriving at the supercontinents.
This slowing of seismic waves led geologists to name the regions large low shear velocity provinces, or LLSVPs.
Velocity loss in seismic waves suggested that these mantle zones were hotter than the rocks around them, Talavera-Soza said.
But it was unknown whether the LLSVPs differed structurally from nearby regions.
Scientists were also uncertain whether the supercontinents were actively involved in convection, or if they were “kind of dense piles that would just be sitting there,” said study coauthor Dr. Arwen Deuss , a professor of structure and composition of Earth's deep interior at Utrecht University.
“There was no information about that,” Deuss said.
“We only knew that seismic waves slowed down.”.
In the new study, the authors used a different approach for studying the LLSVPs to see if they could tease out details about the zones' composition and activity.
They looked at the attenuation, or intensity, of seismic signals as they traveled through the mantle to see how much energy the vibrations from quakes lost.
In music, attenuation is comparable to damping a tone, which produces a lower volume, Deuss said.
Examining the attenuation of the waves — along with changes in wave speed — could provide previously unseen clues about LLSVPs' makeup.
The best data for this is from waves produced by earthquakes that are magnitude 7.8 or higher, Talavera-Soza added.
Wave speed and energy loss were known to be affected by mineral grain size as well as temperature, so the authors used a physics model that linked seismology and mineral physics.
Waves are damped more when they encounter material made of smaller grains; if lots of grains are packed together, there are more boundaries between the grains that can sap a wave's energy.
Other studies revealed that the supercontinents had company in the deep mantle.
Around them were “ slab graveyards ” of sunken tectonic plates, Deuss said.
They were cooler than the LLSVPs, so seismic waves moved through them more quickly.
However, the new model showed that while seismic waves' velocity dipped when they reached LLSVPs, the waves didn't lose much energy.
By comparison, there was significant damping among the cooler graveyards around the LLSVPs.
Researchers believe those differences come down to the comparative ages of the structures.
Over millions of years, as rocky material descends through the boundary between the upper and lower mantle, mineral crystals are compressed and reformed into tinier grains that then regrow over time.
Younger regions therefore have smaller crystals, which suck more energy from seismic waves, so the amount of damping in a region hints at how old it is.
“The fact that the LLSVPs show very little damping, means that they must consist of much larger grains than their surroundings,” Talavera-Soza said.
Larger mineral grains suggested that the supercontinents were significantly older than the tectonic graveyards around them, as their grains must have had more time to grow, according to the study.
Larger building blocks would also make the supercontinents more rigid, keeping them separate from mantle convection, or movement of materials in that layer due to heat transfer.
“Our study points to the LLSVPs being long-lived features, at least half a billion years old, perhaps even older,” Talavera-Soza said.
“This implies they act as anchors at the base of the core-mantle boundary and have survived mantle convection, meaning that the mantle is not well-mixed.”.
This discovery follows another recent revelation about even more “sunken worlds” that contradict the notion of a blended mantle.
Buried plates in tectonic graveyards tend to accumulate in alignment with Earth's subduction zones — regions where the edges of two plates meet, and where one slides beneath the other.
But earlier this year, another team of scientists identified sunken tectonic slabs far from these boundaries in locations under continents' interiors and beneath oceans, where sunken plates had never been found before.
“Apparently, such zones in the Earth's mantle are much more widespread than previously thought,” said Thomas Schouten , lead author of that investigation and a researcher at the Geological Institute of ETH Zurich, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, in a statement .
The model in the new study — the first 3D attenuation model for the entire mantle — will help seismologists to better understand what lies thousands of kilometers below Earth's surface, said Richardson, the doctoral candidate.
“It maps regions of the Earth that weaken seismic energy, ultimately affecting the measurements many seismologists use to understand other physical and chemical properties of Earth's interior,” she said.
The findings could transform researchers' understanding of plate tectonics and how plate movement might be shaped by these ancient, fixed anchors near Earth's core, Deuss said.
Further analysis of the supercontinents could also reveal if they are the source of geochemical elements nearly as old as Earth itself that are found in lava from certain types of volcanoes, she added.
“These LLSVPs have been there for a long time — if they've been there for a billion years, they might have also been there for 4 billion years.
They might well be that hidden reservoir where these chemical primordial elements might be located.
We can't prove that now, but geochemists can investigate this,” Deuss said.
“From this study, I think there will be a lot of extra research that might answer a lot of outstanding questions that have been confusing scientists for ages.”.

Title: Chuck Todd is leaving NBC | CNN Business
# Chuck Todd is leaving NBC | CNN Business.
CNN — .
Chuck Todd, former moderator of NBC's “Meet the Press,” is leaving the network after nearly 20 years.
In an internal memo on Friday, Todd thanked his longtime colleagues and said he has a “few new projects” in the works, signaling a desire for a more entrepreneurial phase of his career.
For that reason, he said he is leaving the network a number of months before his NBC contract was set to expire.
Todd said NBC is allowing him to take his twice-a-week podcast franchise, “The ChuckToddcast,” to a new distributor.
For about a decade, Todd was one of the most prominent voices at NBC News, covering the political rise of Donald Trump and the Democratic response.
He helmed “Meet the Press” from 2014 until 2023.
Todd was outspoken about the corrosive impacts of Trump-era lies and indecency — and was ridiculed by Trump and others for it.
In 2023, after a management change atop NBC News, Todd stepped down from “Meet the Press” and Kristen Welker took over his role.
Todd said it was important not to “overstay” his welcome — a striking message for a Washington crowd full of elderly politicos.
“I'd rather leave a little bit too soon than stay a tad too long,” he added.
Todd saw his air time diminished in recent years, though he remained a prominent part of political and Election Night coverage last November.
In a statement on Friday NBC News said, “We're grateful for Chuck's many contributions to our political coverage during his nearly two-decade career at NBC News and for his deep commitment to 'Meet the Press' and its enduring legacy.
We wish him all the best in his next endeavors.”.
In his memo, Todd said, “The media has a lot of work to do to win back the trust of viewers/listeners/readers and I'm convinced the best place to start is from the bottom up,” with local instead of national media.
“This is a ripe moment,” he added.
“The only way to fix this information ecosystem is to stop whining about the various ways the social media companies are manipulating things and instead roll up our collective sleeves and start with local.”.

Title: Trump said he hadn't read Project 2025 - but most of his early executive orders overlap with its proposals | CNN Politics
# Trump said he hadn't read Project 2025 - but most of his early executive orders overlap with its proposals | CNN Politics.
CNN — .
President Donald Trump caught his own administration off guard last week by suggesting that the nation's primary disaster response agency might simply “go away.” .
Though Trump had routinely lambasted the Federal Emergency Management Agency throughout his third White House bid, he had stopped short of calling for its elimination.
Now, an executive order bearing his signature has put that possibility in motion.
The idea, however, wasn't new.
The contours of it circulated nearly two years ago through Project 2025, a sweeping plan to overhaul the government that Trump as a candidate forcefully disavowed.
Many of Trump's early actions appear closely aligned with Project 2025's plans.
A CNN analysis of the 53 executive orders and actions from Trump's first week in office found that more than two-thirds - 36 - evoke proposals outlined in “Mandate for Leadership,” Project 2025's 922-page blueprint for the next Republican president.
The overlap includes early steps taken by Trump to execute some of his most-touted pledges: cracking down on illegal immigration; dismantling diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives; and rolling back environmental restrictions on oil and gas exploration.
But the framework offered in “Mandate for Leadership” also foreshadowed some of Trump's more provocative and less expected early actions.
It calls for “quickly and aggressively” punishing countries that refuse deported migrants - as Trump did Sunday when Colombia blocked two US military planes carrying deportees.
It advises the president to “immediately revoke the security clearance” of top national security officials accused by conservatives of political bias, a move Trump executed within hours of taking office.
And Trump's directive to curb foreign aid from countries “not fully aligned” with his global aims appeases Project 2025's concern that these programs are “disconnected from the strategy and practice of U.S. foreign policy.”.
“This is exactly the work we set out to do,” Paul Dans, who oversaw Project 2025 at the conservative Heritage Foundation, told CNN in an interview Wednesday.
“It's still in the early first stages of bearing fruit, but we wanted to make sure the president was ready to hit the ground running on day one.
The rapidity and the depth of what they've rolled out this quickly is a testament to the work done in Project 2025 and other presidential transition projects.”.
The fraction of executive actions that so far do not touch on Project 2025 priorities include some of Trump's narrower fixations, like declassifying records on the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, requiring federal workers to return to the office and demanding the flag fly at full staff during presidential inaugurations.
In a statement to CNN, the White House picked up where Trump's campaign left off downplaying any connection between the Republican leader and the conservative playbook.
The president, his spokesman Harrison Fields said, “had nothing to do with Project 2025.” .
“In his first few days in office, President Trump has delivered on the promises that earned him a resounding mandate from the American people - securing the border, restoring common sense, driving down inflation, and unleashing American energy,” Fields said.
The Heritage Foundation declined to comment. .
Think tanks and advocacy organizations from both sides of the aisle typically prepare for incoming administrations with ready-made policy proposals.
But Project 2025 was significant for its breadth and coordination across the conservative movement.
The Heritage Foundation has found success influencing Republican administrations “through the back channels where a lot of Washington work happens” going back to President Ronald Reagan, said Heath Brown, a City University of New York professor who's written multiple books on presidential transitions.
The organization once boasted that Trump during his first year as president had implemented 64 percent of the 334 policies recommended in the 2016 version of “Mandate for Leadership.”
As Trump prepared for a third White House bid, he set the stage for Heritage's seminal work to inform his next administration's priorities once again.
“They're going to lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do,” Trump said during an April 2022 keynote address to the organization first unearthed by the Washington Pos t.
At least 140 former Trump administration officials and dozens of ardent allies ultimately wrote and contributed to “Mandate for Leadership.”
More than 100 friendly organizations endorsed it.
But by mid-2024, with Democrats seizing on Project 2025's more controversial proposals, Trump furiously sought to distance himself from what would become a deeply unpopular manifesto.
“I have nothing to do with Project 2025,” Trump said in the opening moments of his September debate against Vice President Kamala Harris.
“That's out there.
I haven't read it.
I don't want to read it, purposely.
I'm not going to read it.”.
Since his November victory, though, Trump has filled key government posts with people who helped put Project 2025 together.
Both Tom Homan, who is serving as White House border czar, and Trump's new CIA Director John Ratcliffe contributed to “Mandate for Leadership.”
Brendan Carr, named chairman of the Federal Communications Commission by Trump, wrote an entire chapter for Project 2025 on the agency he now leads.
Russ Vought, chosen as director of the Office of Management and Budget, authored a section on presidential power that appeared to preview the freeze on federal spending put in place this week by Trump's young government.
The president, Vought wrote for Project 2025, “should use every possible tool to propose and impose fiscal discipline on the federal government.
Anything short of that would constitute abject failure.”.
Dans, who stepped down from his position in July amid intensifying criticism of Project 2025 from Trump, said the first week of Trump's new term has been “gratifying” to watch.
He called the Democratic Party's “obsession” with Project 2025 - the subject of tens of millions of dollars in negative ads during the presidential race - an “epic electoral fail.”.
Democrats, though, continue to attack Trump over his ties to the conservative blueprint.
Since the election, the Democratic National Committee has sent more than 50 press releases that included the term “Project 2025.”.
Some of the synergy between Trump's early movements and Project 2025 reflect the expected harmony of a new Republican administration and a supportive right-wing group.
Indeed, a considerable share of the manifesto's voluminous policy plans are anchored in two consistent themes: unravel Joe Biden's presidency wherever possible and return to the policies of Trump's first term.
In Trump's first executive order after taking office, he revoked 67 of Biden's executive orders - including at least 15 singled out in “Mandate for Leadership.”.
Meanwhile, reinstating his first-term border policies - such as blocking federal grants to cities that don't comply with immigration enforcement - satisfied some of Project 2025's own immigration prescriptions.
But Trump also moved to restrict temporary protected status for those fleeing humanitarian emergencies, paused disbursements to non-profits assisting undocumented immigrants and mobilized the military to assist in border enforcement - all policies pushed by Project 2025.
“This is not a continuation of the first Trump administration.
It is substantially more aggressive, and he's doing a lot of the things we complained he didn't do in the first term,” said Ken Cuccinelli, the acting deputy secretary for the Department of Homeland Security under Trump who authored the Project 2025 section on his former agency.
The “general aggressiveness is certainly consistent” with what Cuccinelli wrote in Project 2025, he added, pointing especially to the deployment of the military and Trump's use of Department of Justice officers to assist in deportation.
As for FEMA, Cuccinelli in “Mandate for Leadership” urged the new administration to “shift the majority of preparedness and response costs to states and localities.”
The language is recognizable in the proposal Trump floated recently while touring North Carolina flood damage: “We're going to recommend that FEMA go away and we pay directly, we pay a percentage, to the state, and the state should fix it.”.
In his ensuing executive order, Trump launched a commission to review changes to FEMA, including whether the agency should be reformed to function only as a “support agency” to the states.
Michael Coen, a former FEMA chief of staff during the Obama and Biden administrations, said that while he had seen the Project 2025 proposal for the agency, it surprised him to hear Trump vocalize it.
“I never imagined it would be something that he would openly talk about,” Coen said.
“It does seem like there are people in the president's ear that are pushing what is in Project 2025 as far as their plan for FEMA.”.
Cuccinelli acknowledged he also hadn't expected Trump to embrace his proposal on FEMA.
In his first term, Trump relished his power awarding emergency relief to disaster-stricken areas.
“President Trump does love to show up and write checks, but I give him a lot of credit,” Cuccinelli said.
“He clearly recognizes that FEMA as a concept is failing.”.
Coen expects Republican governors and local officials will push back against this worldview.
“States across the country have come to rely on the federal government,” Coen said.
“It's hard to budget for if you're going to get a 500-year rain event that's going to wash away a town, and wash away your critical infrastructure.”.
Trump previewed many of his opening movements as president more than a year ago in a series of policy proposals published on a campaign website called “Agenda47,” such as ending subsidies for electric vehicles, limiting refugee programs and restoring a first-term directive allowing him to remove federal workers deemed insufficiently loyal.
Those ideas were separately backed by Project 2025's authors.
Trump's campaign website made clear he intended to reopen Alaska to drilling - which he did on his first day as president.
Project 2025 endorsed not only the move, but also the urgency.
“Alaska is a special case and deserves immediate action,” one section said.
Some of Project 2025's other priorities have been achieved indirectly through Trump's actions.
For example, a pending plan by the Biden administration for a ground and surface water limit on toxic PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, was withdrawn under Trump's day one freeze on new regulations.
A section on the Environmental Protection Agency in “Mandate for Leadership” encouraged the new president to “revisit the designation of PFAS chemicals as 'hazardous substances.'”.
Groups that had pushed for the Biden administration to crack down on PFAS - known as “forever chemicals” because they don't degrade in the environment - were well aware of the target placed on those regulations by Project 2025, said Melanie Benesh, vice president of governmental affairs at the Environmental Working Group.
There was some reason for optimism, Benesh acknowledged, when Lee Zeldin, Trump's EPA administrator, touted his past work tackling PFAS during his confirmation hearing.
But that hope dissipated when Trump's executive order effectively stalled Biden's planned crackdown.
“It calls into question the incoming administrator's commitment to taking on PFAS,” Benesh told CNN.
EPA spokeswoman Molly Vaseliou said it was “common transition procedure” to hold pending regulations when a new administration comes in.
“President Trump advanced conservation and environmental stewardship while promoting economic growth for families across the country in his first term and will continue to do so this term,” Vaseliou said.
As the administration moves forward, the extent to which Trump's actions run parallel to Project 2025 will remain a central question.
Some of Trump's early executive orders appear to lay the groundwork for future actions advocated by Project 2025.
For example, Trump's national energy emergency calls for a review of regulations protecting endangered and marine wildlife that may be “obstacles to domestic energy infrastructure.”
Project 2025 suggests the new administration move immediately to lift protections on grizzly bears and gray wolves and work with Congress on an overhaul of the Endangered Species Act.
Elsewhere, Trump has taken steps that seem to go beyond what Project 2025 has proposed.
Nowhere in the dozens of pages dedicated to a forceful crackdown on immigration do “Mandate for Leadership” authors suggest declaring the US is under invasion and designating Mexican drug cartels as terrorist groups, as Trump did in his executive orders.
Similarly, Trump exceeded Project 2025's calls to restart federal executions with an executive order expanding the potential crimes that could trigger the death penalty.
Still, not all of Project 2025's plans are necessarily included in the public manifesto.
The project's website acknowledged it intended to deliver the Trump transition a “playbook of actions” for the administration's first 180 days.
Neither Heritage nor the Trump White House would say if that exchange took place.
And in a hidden-camera video of Vought released last year , he said his group was drafting hundreds of potential orders, regulations and memos for Trump.
“With immigration in particular, executive orders aren't necessarily the thing that makes policy change,” said Dara Lind, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, an advocacy group for immigrants.
“What's been notable from the first nine days or so is not just that they had the executive orders ready to go on day one,” but other technical regulations and declarations on hand as well.
“That kind of timeline indicates a certain amount of preparation before getting into office,” she said.
Dans noted Project 2025 also engaged in a nationwide search for Trump loyalists to fill federal agencies with people who would execute his agenda.
“It all comes down to implementation,” Dans said, “And Project 2025 was ultimately about putting in place the people who would come in from outside the swamp and make changes.”.
On at least one issue, Trump is already spurning Project 2025: the future of TikTok.
Trump in an executive order paused a ban on the Chinese social media app, which Project 2025 described as a national security imperative.
Trump also recently said he was “ very unlikely ” to limit abortion pill access.
Project 2025 not only pushes for the administration to reverse federal approval of the abortion pill mifepristone, it also proposes excluding the morning-after pill and men's contraceptives from coverage mandated under the Affordable Care Act.
Trump has, though, moved to restrict federal funding for abortions both domestically and abroad, a stance that also appears in Project 2025's policy framework.
And his nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., told a Senate hearing Wednesday that Trump asked him to “study the safety” of mifepristone.
CNN's review of Trump's executive actions covered the first week of his new term, from his swearing in until noon on Monday.
In the days since, he has remained active, restricting certain treatments for transgender minors, keeping transgender adults out of the military and reinstating servicemembers who were discharged for refusing COVID vaccinations.
Each of those moves had support in Project 2025.

# Tech giants ramp up the battle against online hate speech in Europe.
At home, some are pulling back | CNN Business.
New York CNN — .
Two of America's Big Tech companies are opening the door to more “free expression,” even if it means more hateful content.
But in Europe, Big Tech companies are voluntarily cracking down.
It's a reminder of just how divergent Europeans' and Americans' online experiences are becoming, as EU lawmakers forge ahead with tech safety and accountability legislation against an industry widely seen as too big and too out of control, while such proposals have languished, if not faced active resistance, on Capitol Hill.
Tech platforms including Meta's Facebook and Instagram, X, Snapchat, TikTok, Twitch, LinkedIn and YouTube this week signed onto an updated European Union code of conduct promising to do more to combat online hate speech, which is often illegal in European countries.
Meanwhile, two of those same platforms — Meta and X — have made changes in the United States that they acknowledge could usher in more hateful speech, arguing that such changes promote freedom of speech and combat censorship.
And across the industry, companies have shrunk teams whose entire job was to ensure the safety of their platforms, including from people who seek to foment hate and violence.
The contrast is striking.
As part of the EU agreement, the companies agree to allow “monitoring reporters” — non-profits or public organizations with expertise on hate speech — to review their platforms and to act quickly on most of the content they flag, the European Commission said Monday.
The new code of conduct is voluntary, but tech companies can use their compliance to demonstrate that they are meeting obligations legally required by the EU's Digital Services Act (DSA) , which, among other things, mandates Big Tech platforms take meaningful steps to reduce illegal and harmful content.
“In Europe there is no place for illegal hate, either offline or online,” Henna Virkkunen, the commission's executive vice president for tech sovereignty, security and democracy, said in a statement, adding that the commitments will help “ensure a safe digital space for all.”.
It's one of a number of differences in US versus EU tech users' online experiences that have accumulated over time, Isabelle Wright, director of technology and society at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, told CNN.
“I think we've been heading in this direction for a while, but not just for hate speech, I think really for all categories of harm that most (other) Western nations cover in in their tech regulation,” Wright said.
“It's going to lead to an incredibly fractured information ecosystem between the US and essentially every other Western democracy.”.
Meta and X did not respond to requests for comment.
To be sure, Silicon Valley's efforts have always been far from perfect.
Meta's platforms have been accused of playing a key role in the organization of the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol and abetting genocide in Myanmar.
And across the tech world, efforts to address harmful content like hate speech have always been targeted, at least to some extent, at placating advertisers obsessed with “brand safety,” terrified at the thought that their ads could be placed next to a comment section awash in inflammatory remarks and threats of violence.
With advertising being the prime revenue generator for social media companies, the tastes of advertisers has historically set the tone.
But now even those efforts have been scaled back in the United States.
Elon Musk-owned X has seen an uptick in hate speech in recent years as it welcomed previously banned White supremacists and conspiracy peddlers back to the platform.
Musk himself has also boosted racist conspiracies on the site.
And Meta earlier this month announced several major content moderation policy changes in the United States, including scaling back its automated systems for removing content that violates its policies.
The systems will now be focused on checking only for illegal and “high-severity” violations such as terrorism and child sexual exploitation.
Meta also updated its hateful conduct policy to roll back protections for certain groups, including women and LGBTQ+ people.
Users of Meta's platforms will now, for example, be able to refer to women as household objects and suggest that transgender people are mentally ill, without fear that their comments will be removed or restricted by Facebook's moderation team. (A Meta spokesperson noted that the company would continue to prohibit slurs, as well as attacks against certain groups, such as those based on ethnicity, race and religion.).
Terms of Service with Clare Duffy How Do You Fact-Check Social Media?
Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg says the company is ending its partnership with third-party fact-checkers in the US because the program caused too much censorship on the company's platforms.
The announcement raised a big question: How much were third-party fact-checkers really responsible for what content stays or goes on Meta's platforms?

The platforms' US moves may reflect the changing American political environment, where many Republican leaders have equated content moderation with “censorship.” .
Members of the incoming Donald Trump administration, including the nominee to lead the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr, have also called for a reinterpretation of the tech immunity law Section 230.
In essence, they want tech companies to be protected from lawsuits over what their users post only if they do little-to-no content moderation whatsoever.
Following Meta's announcement earlier this month, Carr posted a gif of Jack Nicholson grinning and nodding in response to CNN's Brian Stelter post on X with the news about the tech giant's moderation policy.
When tech platforms announce changing policies or principles, Wright said, “the language they use to stand behind those indicates that they've put in, you know, a lot of a lot of thought and consultation into these processes.
Yet when an administration changes, those principles seem to change like the wind in order to better align with the people who could potentially regulate them or disrupt their businesses.”.
“I think what has become clear to the platforms is that the chances of any type of tech regulation in the US are slim to none,” Wright said.
But it isn't just hate speech where Americans have a different experience.
Europeans are protected in much broader ways, too.
Unlike Americans, Europeans are protected from having their personal demographic information, such as their race and political views, collected by tech companies without their consent, thanks to the General Data Protection Regulation .
Nor can Big Tech firms stop app developers from communicating cheaper, off-platform offers to users because of the Digital Markets Act .
The DSA also provides EU users with greater protections from targeted online ads.
And Europeans may have less access to AI tools, including products from Apple and Meta , because of privacy regulations and an EU law aimed at safe and responsible development of the technology.
But that divergence has the potential to become less pronounced as tech leaders have cozied up to Trump in the hopes that the new administration will advance their interests.
Zuckerberg and Musk, as well as Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and TikTok CEO Shou Chew, were all seated prominently at Trump's inauguration Monday.
Some of those Big Tech CEOs have already suggested they want Trump to pressure Europe into relaxing protections and regulations on the continent.
Cook is said to have raised the issue of European regulations in a meeting with Trump at Mar-a-Lago following the election.
And Zuckerberg has expressly said he will seek Trump's help in pushing back on safety rules from the EU and elsewhere.
In his policy announcement earlier this month, Zuckerberg said: “We're going to work with President Trump to push back on governments around the world that are going after American companies and pushing to censor more.”.

Title: Trump fires head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau | CNN Business
# Trump fires head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau | CNN Business.
New York CNN — .
President Donald Trump has fired Rohit Chopra, the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
Chopra received an email from the White House on Saturday morning informing him of the firing, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.
Chopra, who has been targeted by Republican lawmakers for putting restrictions on financial institutions in favor of consumers, announced his departure in a post on X on Saturday.
“This letter confirms that my term as CFPB Director has concluded.
I know the CFPB is ready to work with you and the next confirmed Director, and we have a great deal of energy to ensure continued success,” Chopra wrote .
The CFPB declined to comment on the news.
“It's the executive's decision and prerogative to see who they want in that role,” a White House official told CNN.
Major consumer banks including Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase are among companies facing lawsuits from the CFPB.
They, alongside tech industry leaders, have encouraged Trump to remove Chopra from his role — which was made possible by a 2020 Supreme Court ruling that enabled presidents to fire CFPB directors.
Chopra was appointed in 2021 by former President Joe Biden to serve as director of the bureau that regulates financial agencies.
The director of the CFPB, who under law was to serve a five-year term, also serves as a board member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, voting on key banking regulations.
Chopra will no longer be serving in that role either.
In his time at the CFPB, Chopra spearheaded controversial regulation limiting overdraft fees banks can charge as well as late fees credit card companies could collect from customers.
The rule intending to cap credit card late fees at $8 was later struck down by a federal judge.
The CFPB rule on overdraft fees, which would cap them at $5 — a substantial savings from the $35 that customers are typically charged — was finalized at the end of last year but is likely to face legal challenges , as well.
Under Chopra's leadership, the CFPB also finalized a rule making personal data more accessible so that it is easier to switch banks.
Before Trump took office this month, the agency finalized a rule that would remove about $49 billion in medical bills from credit reports.
“People who get sick shouldn't have their financial future upended,” said Chopra in a statement on January 7.
The consumer watchdog agency was created after the 2008 financial crisis by way of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.
The agency was the brainchild of Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who began advocating for it in 2007 when she was a Harvard Law School professor.
Warren, the ranking member of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, applauded Chopra for “holding Wall Street accountable for cheating hard-working families,” she said Saturday in a statement.
Despite their differences with Trump, Warren and several progressive lawmakers, including Sen. Bernie Sanders, have signaled their support for the president's campaign promise to temporarily cap credit interest rates at 10% — less than half of current rates according to Federal Reserve data.
To fulfill this promise, Warren said Trump “needs a strong CFPB and a strong CFPB director,” adding that “if President Trump and Republicans decide to cower to Wall Street billionaires and destroy the agency, they will have a fight on their hands.”.

Title: Trump's FCC is investigating NPR and PBS stations over sponsorships | CNN Business
# Trump's FCC is investigating NPR and PBS stations over sponsorships | CNN Business.
CNN — .
Brendan Carr, the Federal Communications Commission's new chairman, on Wednesday ordered an investigation into the sponsorship practices of NPR and PBS member stations.
In a letter obtained by CNN, Carr said he was “concerned that NPR and PBS broadcasts could be violating federal law by airing commercials.” .
“In particular, it is possible that NPR and PBS member stations are broadcasting underwriting announcements that cross the line into prohibited commercial advertisements,” Carr wrote in the letter, which was sent to NPR chief executive Katherine Maher and PBS president and chief executive Paula Kerger.
NPR and PBS programming is aired to a network of around 1,500 member stations, all of which choose which programs to broadcast.
The stations require licenses approved by the FCC to operate, and these licenses limit them as non-commercial educational broadcast stations, which are prohibited by federal law from airing advertisements.
The FCC's investigation will probe the underwriting announcements and policies of NPR and PBS, as well as their broadcast stations.
In a statement , Maher emphasized that the radio broadcaster and its member stations have complied with FCC regulations.
“We are confident any review of our programming and underwriting practices will confirm NPR's adherence to these rules,” Maher wrote.
PBS, likewise, defended its compliance with FCC standards, saying in a statement that it has worked “diligently to comply with the FCC's underwriting regulations.”.
Carr also sent the letter to congressional lawmakers, noting the investigation “may prove relevant to an ongoing legislative debate” over whether “to stop requiring taxpayers to subsidize NPR and PBS programming.”.
“To the extent that these taxpayer dollars are being used to support a for profit endeavor or an entity that is airing commercial advertisements, then that would further undermine any case for continuing to fund NPR and PBS with taxpayer dollars,” he wrote.
The investigation was first reported by the New York Times .
The FCC's probe echoes President Trump's attacks on news organizations whose reporting he takes issue with.
Last week, the FCC chair reversed eleventh-hour decisions from his predecessor, Jessica Rosenworcel, to dismiss complaints that had been brought against local CBS, ABC and NBC stations.
Notably, Rosenworcel also dismissed a complaint that had blocked a Philly-based Fox division's license renewal — a decision Carr did not reverse.
“We don't have the luxury of doing anything other than making very, very clear that this agency and its licensing authority should not be weaponized in a way that is fundamentally at odds with the First Amendment,” Rosenworcel wrote in a January 16 statement. .
Trump's ire against the press is nothing new — as part of his retaliation against those who he believes have wronged him .
On the campaign trail, he repeatedly took aim at news publishers.
For example, in March , Trump slapped ABC News and George Stephanopoulos with a lawsuit that the Disney-owned broadcaster eventually settled for $15 million .
And in November , Trump sued CBS over the network's “60 Minutes” interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris.
CNN's October review of Trump's speeches and social media posts found that over the past two years, he has called for every major American TV news network to be punished.
Just two days after reassuming the presidency, Trump took aim at MSNBC in a Truth Social post .
“MSDNC is even worse than CNN,” Trump wrote.
“They shouldn't even have a right to broadcast — Only in America.”.

Title: Women's college basketball greats Caitlin Clark and A'ja Wilson's collegiate jerseys retired | CNN
# Women's college basketball greats Caitlin Clark and A'ja Wilson's collegiate jerseys retired | CNN.
CNN — .
Caitlin Clark and A'ja Wilson , who both helped elevate the game of women's college basketball, had their respective No. 22 jersey retired Sunday at the schools where they became bona fide superstars.
Clark, the all-time leading scorer in NCAA men's and women's Division I basketball history, had her jersey raised to the rafters at Carver-Hawkeye Arena in Iowa City, Iowa, after the Iowa Hawkeyes' 76-69 upset win against the No. 4 USC Trojans.
Clark thanked her former teammates who were in attendance for the ceremony.
“I'm pretty overwhelmed right now,” the West Des Moines, Iowa, native told the sold-out crowd.
“I wouldn't be here without any of you and a lot of you came back.
You all have busy schedules and that just speaks to the culture of this place, so selfless.
I know my number is up there, but it wouldn't be if it weren't for all of you.”.
Clark led Iowa to two consecutive national title games.
In her senior season, she led the nation in scoring (31.6 per game) and assists (8.9 per game)..
She also showed some love to her former head coach and everyone who has supported her throughout her career.
“There wasn't many people when I first signed here when I said, 'I wanted to take this place to the Final Four' that they kind of laughed at me and Coach (Lisa Bluder) was literally the only person that agreed with me, thank God, or else we probably wouldn't be here.
I'm just very lucky and fortunate.”.
Clark added: “To all the people that just poured into me over the course of my career, from the people that don't get any recognition, from our media team, to our managers, all of you that have given so much of yourselves to allow me to be who I am, thank you.
I can't say it enough.
I wouldn't be here without all of you.”.
The 23-year-old is the only Division I player, man or woman, to lead her conference (Big Ten) in scoring and assists in four consecutive seasons.
She was selected to the All-Big Ten first team four times in four years, the first to ever do so in program history.
The Indiana Fever picked her with the No. 1 overall selection in the 2024 WNBA draft.
The National Player of the Year capped off a historic career at Iowa by having a groundbreaking year in her first season in the league.
Clark won the 2024 Rookie of the Year award in a near-unanimous vote.
## A'ja Wilson: 'I am overwhelmed with gratitude and joy' .
Wilson got very emotional as her jersey was lifted to the Colonial Life Arena's rafters in Columbia, South Carolina, before No. 2 Gamecocks' 83-66 victory over the Auburn Tigers.
“I am overwhelmed with gratitude and joy to have my jersey retired at the University of South Carolina, the place where my dreams began is an honor I can hardly put into words,” the school's first four-time All-American and National Player of the Year in 2018 told the Gamecock faithful.
“Columbia, South Carolina, is my home and it shaped me not just as an athlete but as a person.
As I would look up in the in the rafters and see my jersey, I'm reminded how important it is to chase your dreams without fear.”.
South Carolina's all-time leading scorer still currently holds 22 school records.
Wilson led the Gamecocks to their first Southeastern Conference (SEC) tournament title, first NCAA Final Four and first NCAA national championship.
She is also the first player in SEC history to win the Player of the Year three times.
The 28-year-old expressed gratitude to the “incredible” fans and South Carolina head coach Dawn Staley for their support.
“You fill this arena with energy and passion, making every game an unforgettable experience.
It's a privilege to be a Gamecock, to be a part of this community and one of the greatest honors of my life was representing Garnet and Black every night.”.
She continued: “Thank you coach for seeing the light in me even when I couldn't see it in myself and for showing me that it's not about the destination but the journey and the people you meet along the way.”.
Wilson was the top overall selection in the 2018 WNBA draft by the Las Vegas Aces as she became the first South Carolina player to accomplish that feat.
Wilson was unanimously selected 2018 WNBA Rookie of the Year.
In 2021, South Carolina honored Wilson with an 11-foot bronze statue outside the main entrance of the arena.
Last season, Wilson was unanimously named the WNBA MVP, her third time winning the award and set the record for the most points in a WNBA season .
The No. 22 jersey will never be worn by any women's college basketball player at Iowa or South Carolina.

Title: Summary of 2025 Grammys: Artists show support for LA and more great moments | CNN
# Summary of 2025 Grammys: Artists show support for LA and more great moments | CNN.
CNN — .
The 2025 Grammys had a tough task.
Music's biggest night took place in Los Angeles, just weeks after wildfires left unprecedented destruction across the city.
Instead of looking away, the award show chose to use the platform and captive audience for good and a lot of singing and dancing along the way.
At the top of the show, host Trevor Noah said that instead of just celebrating music, the ceremony would be “a celebration of the humanity and spirit of survival.”
And that it was.
Here's some of highlights of the ceremony, including, yes, Beyoncé's big win:.
They finally said her name.
Beyoncé won the Grammy for album of the year for her genre-bending “Cowboy Carter,” capturing an elusive first win in the category after four previous nominations over the course of her highly-decorated career.
Presented to her by members of the Los Angeles Fire Department, Beyoncé accepted the award while standing next to her daughter, Blu Ivy.
“I just feel very full and very honored,” she said.
“It's been many, many years.”.
Lady Gaga and Billie Eilish were seen with tears in their eyes watching from the crowd.
The win was Beyoncé's third of the night.
The Grammy Awards' love for the City of Angels began with an opening act that brought Altadena natives Dawes to the stage with Sheryl Crow, Brad Paisley, John Legend, Brittany Howard and St. Vincent for an unforgettable cover of Randy Newman's “I Love L.A.” And it didn't end there.
Commercial time was given to local businesses affected by last month's wildfire, with famous faces making cameos.
Noah directed viewers to a QR code on the screen to raise money for MusiCares Fire Relief and other charities - $7 million was raised during the show, he announced near the end of the broadcast.
LA-native Billie Eilish performed her hit “Birds of a Feather” in a rustic setting reminiscent of the hiking trails throughout LA County, while what appeared to be childhood photos showed in the background.
Later, Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars took the stage to perform a pared down cover of the 1965 song “California Dreamin'” by The Mamas & the Papas, following a pre-taped piece that highlighted harrowing images of damaged homes and heartbroken families.
Gloomy?
At times, but the show's main message was one of hope and an invitation to join those finding ways to usher in better days.
The task of striking the right tone for the night rested upon the capable shoulders of comedian Noah.
The five-time host knew when to have fun and when to let the moment breathe.
Speaking of the relief efforts, Noah said, “You know, it's often said that in the darkest times, the best of humanity shines through.”.
With ease and an authentic charm, Noah, too, shined.
Let's be clear: Speeches are hard.
But this year's Grammy winners came prepared.
Doechii, winner for best rap album, was among those who took the stage with a heartfelt message that acknowledged her position in history as only the third female to win the award. (Lauryn Hill and Cardi B were the others.).
“I put my heart and my soul into this mixtape,” she said.
“I bared my life.
I went through so much.
I dedicated myself to sobriety and God told me that I would be rewarded.”.
She concluded her speech with words of inspiration.
“I know that there is some Black girl out there, so many Black women out there, that were watching me right now and I want to tell you.
Anything is possible,” she said. “
Don't allow anybody to project any stereotypes on you that tell you you can't be here, that you're too dark or that you're not smart enough or that you're too dramatic or you're too loud.
You are exactly who you need to be to be right where you are and I am a testimony.”.
Beyoncé, winner for best country album for “Cowboy Carter,' also brought a message of empowerment, prior to her win for album of the year.
“I think sometimes genre is a cold word to keep us in our place as artists,” she said.
“And I just want to encourage people to do what they're passionate about and stay persistent.”.
Later, best new artist winner Chappell Roan stood up for emerging artists, calling on record companies to provide living wages and health care for rising artists.
She's been in their shoes, she said.
“It was so devastating to feel so committed to my art and feel so betrayed by the system and so dehumanized to not have help,” she said, adding, “Labels, we got you, but do you got us?”.
Honorees didn't steer away from political subjects, with Shakira dedicating her fourth career Grammy to immigrants, Lady Gaga speaking in support of the LGBTQ community and Alicia Keys addressing recent attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion programs.
“DEI is not a threat; it's a gift,” she said.
Best new artist nominee Raye may soon join the ranks of other musicians known by a singular name after her memorable performance.
With strings and horns section behind her, she sang a rendition of her song “Oscar Winning Tears,” closing out a series of performances by those nominated in that category - including Doechii, Benson Boone, Teddy Swims and Khruangbin.
Later, in a tribute to the late producer and musician Quincy Jones, introduced by Will Smith, “Wicked” star Cynthia Erivo performed a sublime version of “Fly Me To the Moon,” the hit standard Jones produced for Frank Sinatra in 1964.
Lainey Wilson, Herbie Hancock, Stevie Wonder and more joined in the tribute.
Wonder praised Jones' generosity and the work he did to produce “We Are the World.”.
Also, shoutout to Shakira, whose hips and abs still don't lie but do defy the laws of nature.

President Donald Trump on Wednesday batted down the national security concerns surrounding TikTok, saying, “Is it that important for China to be spying on young people?
On young kids watching crazy videos?”.
It was a su

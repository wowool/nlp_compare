Title: Americans may find themselves paying the cost of tariffs on imports | CNN Politics
# Americans may find themselves paying the cost of tariffs on imports | CNN Politics.
CNN — .
A day after signing steep new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China, President Donald Trump acknowledged what economists, members of Congress and even some of his own aides — in their previous lives — have been saying all along: Americans may find themselves paying the costs .
“THIS WILL BE THE GOLDEN AGE OF AMERICA!
WILL THERE BE SOME PAIN?
YES, MAYBE (AND MAYBE NOT!),” Trump posted, in all capital letters, on his Truth Social platform.
The message, which appeared in the hour before Trump arrived to his West Palm Beach, Florida, golf club for the second day in a row, amounted to an advance warning.
Trump is serious about fulfilling his campaign promises to end illegal immigration, curb the flow of deadly drugs and rebalance continental trade.
But doing so will be uncomfortable, Trump is suggesting, and could serve to undermine another of his top campaign vows: lowering costs for Americans.
“WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AND IT WILL ALL BE WORTH THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID,” Trump wrote.
“WE ARE A COUNTRY THAT IS NOW BEING RUN WITH COMMON SENSE — AND THE RESULTS WILL BE SPECTACULAR!!!”.
Instead of the new trade war lowering grocery or fuel prices, Trump on Sunday pointed to a result he never mentioned when he was running for president: annexing Canada as an American state.
“Canada should become our Cherished 51st State.
Much lower taxes, and far better military protection for the people of Canada — AND NO TARIFFS!
” he said, repeating an idea he's floated repeatedly since winning the election late last year.
As industries brace for the new tariffs — 25% on goods from Mexico and Canada, and 10% on imports from China — it remains to be seen how long it will take for higher costs to have an impact on American consumers.
The tariffs are set to go into effect Tuesday at 12:01 a.m. ET.
In a tacit acknowledgement that upside pressures could affect Americans' gas and heating costs, Trump levied only a 10% tariff on Canadian oil and gas.
Already, Canada and Mexico have moved to retaliate — reluctantly, in the case of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who said during a somber address from Ottawa late Saturday: “We don't want to be here.”.
Canada's former finance minister Chrystia Freeland, who is running to replace Trudeau as prime minister, said her country would rather not get into a trade war with the US but is determined to stand up for itself.
“We don't want to have this fight, but we are not going to lose it,” she told CNN's Fareed Zakaria on Sunday, calling it a “lose-lose” situation that will end up hurting Americans, since they depend on Canada for many basic goods.
If the back-and-forth tariffs remain in place for a prolonged period, the “pain” Trump warned of could become a reality.
Sen. Tim Kaine argued Sunday on “State of the Union” that Americans will see increased prices at the pump within days and that American businesses will be harmed once the other nations' retaliatory tariffs kick in.
“I'm struck by the irony.
Last week, the president signed an emergency order regarding energy.
There's an energy emergency.
And he just put a 10% tariff on energy from Canada?
” the Virginia Democrat told CNN's Jake Tapper, adding, “The emergency is self-created.”.
Democratic Gov.
Andy Beshear of Kentucky, which Trump won by more than 30 percentage points in the 2024 election, warned of the potential impacts on the state's bourbon industry after the provinces of British Columbia and Ontario directed their liquor boards to remove American alcohol from shelves.
But even some Trump allies have privately hoped that after implementing the harsh new duties — and proving to the world he's willing to act decisively — Trump could eventually ease up, as long as he's extracted some concessions.
Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, told “Fox News Sunday” that the tariffs “are designed to bring about change.
And if the change comes, I think the tariffs probably go away.”.
What exactly those concessions might be, however, isn't clear.
Before implementing the tariffs, Trump did not meet or speak on the telephone with Trudeau or with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum to spell out his demands.
Trudeau said Saturday he'd been trying to reach Trump since the inauguration, but his calls have not been returned.
Briefing reporters Saturday evening, White House officials declined to lay out specific benchmarks that Canada or Mexico could reach in tightening their borders or curbing fentanyl flows that would allow the tariffs to be lifted.
And Trump himself told reporters late Friday he wasn't looking for any concessions at all.
In his social media posting Sunday morning, his rationale for the tariffs extended well beyond punishment for the illicit flow of fentanyl.
“The USA has major deficits with Canada, Mexico, and China (and almost all countries!), owes 36 Trillion Dollars, and we're not going to be the 'Stupid Country' any longer,” he wrote.
“MAKE YOUR PRODUCT IN THE USA AND THERE ARE NO TARIFFS!”.

Title: Inside the grueling effort to recover the bodies of all 67 victims from the mangled wreckage of DC plane collision | CNN
# Inside the grueling effort to recover the bodies of all 67 victims from the mangled wreckage of DC plane collision | CNN.
CNN — .
Families were waiting at the airport to welcome home loved ones when their plane, just minutes from landing, collided midair with a military helicopter in a fiery explosion, plunging 67 lives full of promise into the cold, inky waters of the Potomac River.
The frantic search for survivors started under the cloak of icy darkness.
By morning, the mission had turned into a slow and somber search for the remains of everyone on board.
As of Sunday afternoon, 55 bodies have been identified, DC Fire and EMS Chief John Donnelly said, with the search effort hampered by near-zero visibility in the frigid water , sharp pieces of debris and the mangled metal of the wreckage.
Amid heated political speculation on the cause of Wednesday night's collision and grief-stricken stories from heartbroken loved ones, hundreds of rescue personnel continue to search relentlessly for the remains of every person lost.
“They're getting home and they're crashing and falling into really deep sleeps, and then getting up and going back to work and doing it again,” David Hoagland, president of the Washington, DC, Firefighters Local 36, told CNN.
“However long it takes, they're going to be there.”.
Days later, dangerous and difficult conditions persist, hindering the careful and deliberate efforts of crews working to recover the bodies of victims trapped deep within the wreckage, beyond the reach of divers.
The recovery effort has been extensive, involving nearly every dive team in the area, including the US Coast Guard, the FBI's Washington Field Office dive team, DC Fire and the International Association of Fire Fighters.
Here's how their efforts are unfolding.
## Heavier equipment needed to remove remaining bodies .
The mangled wreckage in the Potomac River has made the recovery effort especially difficult for dive teams, who have struggled to access parts of the plane's fuselage.
These sections will need to be removed to retrieve the remaining bodies, Donnelly said.
“Things have kind of slowed down this weekend because they're waiting on a lot more heavier salvage equipment that's going to be showing up sometime in the next 24 to 36 hours,” Hoagland told CNN on Saturday.
“They're going to be setting up for a pretty complicated operation where they're going to be removing plane parts from the water on Monday.”.
The wreckage of the American Airlines jet broke apart, according to Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy.
The fuselage was found upside down in three sections in the river, which is about 8 feet deep in some areas.
Divers have been using specialized underwater hydraulic rescue tools capable of cutting metal to try to recover as many victims as possible, Hoagland said.
Asked whether authorities are confident about the location of the remaining bodies, Donnelly said, “We think we know where they are,” but “we won't know until we're done.”.
“I believe that when we remove the aircraft, that that will help us resolve this number,” he said.
“If it doesn't, we will continue the search.”.
The Army Corps of Engineers will start working to remove the remnants of the jet Monday, according to a news release .
Then, engineers will switch their focus to the remnants of the Black Hawk helicopter involved in the collision.
They expect to finish removing the wreckage by February 12, the release says.
A US Coast Guard boat equipped with a crane was used Friday to hold the door of the US Army Black Hawk helicopter, allowing for the retrieval of the bodies of all three service members, followed by the “dignified transfer of their remains,” Hoagland said.
The wreckage of the helicopter was located about 300 yards from the plane debris, according to Hoagland.
Most of Friday's recovery operations focused on the Black Hawk.
Recovery teams are planning to bring a larger crane to the Potomac crash site to help reach victims in a section of the wreckage divers can't access, a law enforcement source told CNN.
The crane, used to remove parts of the Francis Scott Key Bridge after its collapse last March, will be employed to cut and lift pieces of the airplane.
This will allow divers to safely recover additional victims who are pinned inside and extremely difficult to access.
“With these really large marine salvage cranes and vessels, as you can imagine, these things are not very seaworthy,” Hoagland said.
“They can't move very fast because they've got giant cranes on them, so it's slow sail to get up the bay and then into the river to get up to DC.”.
Rescue teams are also on the water using technology such as sonar scanning to continue their search and deploy divers.
Additionally, crews will search sewer lines and conduct aerial operations as dive teams work in targeted areas, according to Donnelly.
## Dangerous, difficult and risky conditions .
When a direct line to Reagan National Airport rang Wednesday night, Hoagland said, Local 36 first responders expected a routine report of a flight in distress.
Instead, they heard: “Crash!
Crash!
Crash!
” he recalled.
As union members rushed to a pier to board a fireboat, burning debris rained down on Potomac.
First responders arrived to find wreckage submerged in the shallow water and almost immediately started finding victims, Hoagland said.
Some passengers were still strapped to their seats, but removing them proved difficult as sharp pieces of debris tore the wetsuits worn by first responders.
“They had a lot working against them.
They had the current in the river.
They had jet fuel all over in the water with them.
They had debris.
They had ice,” Edward Kelly, general president of the International Association of Fire Fighters, told CNN on Thursday. “
Like I said, the swift current was a challenge, searching the fuselage - there's a lot of sharp objects in the cockpit - so it was a very difficult and risky and dangerous rescue attempt.”.
At one point, there were close to 50 divers in the water responding to the incident, he said.
“One thing that was a blessing was the civilian dinner boat in DC did a trip up the Potomac yesterday, which actually broke the ice that allowed the smaller boats to respond to the actual crash last night,” he said.
On the night of the crash, emergency crews battled icy, choppy waters, Donnelly said . .
“The water is dark, it is murky, and that is a very tough condition for them to dive in.
If you can imagine, the river is a large black spot at night with no lights on it, except for a few buoy lights,” Donnelly said.
Friday, search crews continued to exercise caution as weather conditions posed challenges for recovery efforts, Donnelly said.
Divers faced intense mud and near-zero visibility, despite the aircraft resting in only a few feet of water.
“That's actually part of the challenge, is that you're half swimming, half walking while you're working.
This is very strenuous for our divers or rescue swimmers that are in the water,” Donnelly said, referring to the silt at the bottom.
Saturday, calmer weather — with sunshine and fewer winds — helped with visibility, but ice and debris remained critical hazards, Hoagland told CNN.
He added officials are still in the process of mapping the debris field.
“Now that it's a recovery operation, it's much more important to preserve evidence so they can investigate the crash, so they're going to go about it systematically, methodically and intentionally,” Hoagland said.
“They're doing a good job of cataloging and mapping everything by sonar and figuring out where everything is, but it's a tedious, long effort.”.
With the operation shifted from a rescue to a recovery mission, responders are adopting an approach that prioritizes safety, according to Kelly.
For instance, responders will not perform dangerous night dives.
First responders and emergency personnel, who have been working around the clock for days — first desperately searching for survivors, and now recovering remains — are exhausted, Hoagland said, but remain resilient.
“Everybody just really wants to see things through,” Hoagland told CNN.
“We're looking out for each other, and everybody's getting breaks.”.
Recovering the bodies and remains of the victims, especially the children, has been both harrowing and exhausting, Hoagland said, a process that will likely leave a lasting emotional and mental impact on first responders.
To support first responders dealing with the trauma of what they're witnessing on the scene, the International Association of Fire Fighters has deployed teams of former firefighters trained as mental health counselors to assist with ongoing recovery efforts.
“If somebody's really just having a tough time and they need to hit the pause button, they can talk to them and help them decompress and process all the trauma they might be experiencing,” Hoagland said.
There are enough teams on the ground for everyone to provide each other with peer support and take someone's place if they are overwhelmed and need a break, Hoagland said.
Donnelly also emphasized the importance of making sure personnel “understand that the feelings they have are normal and how to get help if there's any feelings that aren't going away, the signs and symptoms, if you're having trouble sleeping, if you aren't eating well, we don't want you to drink, we don't want you arguing with your family,” he said in a news conference Sunday.
The US Coast Guard has Critical Incident Stress Management therapists and chaplains who are waiting for US Coast Guard crews to return to home base and will provide them with mental health support immediately, the agency's Capt. Patrick Burkett said at the news conference.
“This is not normal, and it's OK for them to not feel OK,” Burkett said.
“This is a tragedy,” Donnelly said.
“We are in a business where we deal with the loss of life or people being hurt and one person is bad, and it's hard — and 67 is a lot.”.
The National Transportation Safety Board will allow first responders to complete their work before beginning its investigation into the collision, the board's chair said Thursday.
NTSB Chair Jennifer L. Homendy described it as an “all-hands-on-deck event.”
The NTSB had a full crew on the scene Thursday, with about 50 people at the crash site and additional personnel at the agency's headquarters and labs across the country ready to assist.
But first, “we allow the responders to do their important safety mission, which in this case was search and rescue and recovery,” she said.
“We stand back to allow them to do their important safety mission.”.
Homendy emphasized the NTSB will “leave no stone unturned in this investigation” and that it will be a “whole-of-government effort.”.

Title: Luka Doncic breaks silence following trade from Dallas Mavericks: 'I wanted so badly to bring you a championship' | CNN
# Luka Doncic breaks silence following trade from Dallas Mavericks: 'I wanted so badly to bring you a championship' | CNN.
CNN — .
In his first comments since being traded to the Los Angeles Lakers earlier Sunday, NBA superstar Luka Doncic penned a thank you letter to the Dallas Mavericks, their fans and the city of Dallas.
“Seven years ago, I came here as a teenager to pursue my dream of playing basketball at the highest level,” Doncic wrote in a post on X. “I thought I'd spend my career here and I wanted so badly to bring you a championship.
The love and support you all have given me is more than I could have ever dreamed of.
For a young kid from Slovenia coming to the U.S. for the first time, you made North Texas feel like home.” .
In one of the most stunning trades in league history, the Lakers acquired Doncic, as well as Maxi Kleber, Markieff Morris from the Dallas Mavericks for Anthony Davis, Max Christie and the Lakers' 2029 first-round draft pick.
ESPN's Shams Charania first broke the news of the blockbuster trade on Saturday, citing sources.
“In good times and bad, from injuries to the NBA Finals, your support never changed,” Doncic continued.
“Thank you not only for sharing my joy in our best moments, but also for lifting me up when I needed it most.”.
Doncic, 25, is currently out with a calf injury but has averaged 28.1 points, 8.3 rebounds and 7.8 assists per game in 22 games with the Mavericks this season.
Doncic added: “To all the organizations I've worked with throughout the Dallas community, thank you for letting me contribute to your important work and join you in bringing light to those who need it.
As I start the next part of my basketball journey, I am leaving a city that will always feel like a home away from home.”.
A part of the three-team deal, the Utah Jazz are acquiring Jalen Hood-Schifino, a 2025 Los Angeles Clippers second-round draft pick, and a 2025 Mavericks second-round pick to round out the trade.
The five-time All-Star said he was “grateful” for the opportunity to play in Los Angeles alongside LeBron James.
“Basketball means everything to me, and no matter where I play the game, I'll do so with the same joy, passion and goal - to win championships.,” Doncic said.
Per ESPN's Tim MacMahon, the Mavericks had “major concerns” with Doncic's conditioning and impending potential supermax contract extension.
Even with those concerns going public, it's still a shocking decision by the organization - Doncic was on the All-NBA Team for the last five years and made five consecutive All Star teams before this season when he's been limited by injury.
“Dallas is a special place, and Mavs fans are special fans.
Thank you, from the bottom of my heart,” Doncic posted .
While there is no timetable for Doncic's return to the court, the Lakers are next scheduled to play on Tuesday against crosstown rivals Los Angeles Clippers at the Intuit Dome.

Title: A trans National Guard pilot was falsely accused of flying the helicopter in the fatal plane collision | CNN Business
# A trans National Guard pilot was falsely accused of flying the helicopter in the fatal plane collision | CNN Business.
CNN — .
A trans member of the National Guard is speaking out after a wave of claims on social media falsely pointed to her as the pilot of the Black Hawk helicopter that collided with a passenger jet in Washington, Wednesday, killing 67 people.
Jo Ellis, a UH60 Black Hawk helicopter pilot for the Virginia Army National Guard, posted on Facebook Friday to dispel the rumors that had echoed President Donald Trump's unsubstantiated blaming of diversity initiatives for the fatal accident.
“Some craziness has happened on the internet and I'm being named as one of the pilots of the DC crash,” Ellis wrote.
“It's insulting to the victims and families of those lost and they deserve better than this BS from the bots and trolls of the internet.”.
In her Facebook post, Ellis shared a screenshot of two X posts that linked her being trans to the catastrophic crash, with one user saying they “wouldn't be surprised” if “the pilot was trans” in response to another post that claimed Ellis “has been making radicalized anti-Trump statements on socials.
The latter account has since deleted the post and published an apology .
A separate account, which has a blue checkmark and 13,600 followers, shared a now-deleted post directly attacking Ellis and spreading the bogus conspiracy theory.
While the account has likewise issued a correction , the post still raked in at least 195,000 views and was reshared almost 1,000 times before being deleted.
At the time of both corrections, “Jo Ellis” was the No. 3 trending topic on X, with 19,400 posts.
And, despite Ellis' correction — which she further addressed in a follow-up Facebook video , captioned “proof of life” — far-right accounts on X have continued to spread misinformation and hate speech.
Ellis' erroneous scapegoating in far-right circles follows the ﻿guardswoman's publicized sit-down with CNN's Michael Smerconish, slated to appear in Saturday's episode of “The Smerconish Podcast” during which she discussed her service and experiences with gender dysphoria.
In an essay for Smerconish's newsletter , Ellis also discussed her story, writing about transitioning while serving in the military.
Hate speech following the crash echoed recent attacks from Trump on DEI initiatives and executive actions targeting transgender Americans.
Since returning to the Oval Office, Trump has repeatedly taken aim at transgender people, saying in his inauguration speech “that there are only two genders: male and female.”
Amid his flurry of executive orders, Trump has also re-banned transgender Americans from serving in the military , reviving his 2017 order that was repealed by then-President Joe Biden in 2021 .
And, in his first White House briefing room address , Trump directly linked the crash to DEI while also blaming initiatives from Democrats.
“We must have only the highest standards for those who work in our aviation system,” Trump said.
“I changed the Obama standards from very mediocre at best to extraordinary, you remember that.”.
“Only the highest aptitude, they have to be the highest intellect and psychologically superior people, were allowed to qualify for air traffic controllers,” he said.
In a Thursday White House memo , Trump blamed the Obama administration's implementation of “a biographical questionnaire at the FAA to shift the hiring focus away from objective aptitude,” further linking the crash to DEI initiatives.
“The Biden Administration egregiously rejected merit-based hiring, requiring all executive departments and agencies to implement dangerous 'diversity equity and inclusion' tactics, and specifically recruiting individuals with “severe intellectual” disabilities in the FAA,” Trump wrote in the memo.
Neither the memo nor Trump's press conference provided any evidence to support his brazen claims.
When one reporter pressed the president for an explanation of his diversity claims during the press conference, Trump again failed to provide evidence, responding simply: “Because common sense and unfortunately a lot of people don't.”.
Baseless DEI attacks have become one of the key pillars of the president's MAGA platform, and Trump is far from alone in linking disasters to diversity initiatives.
When disastrous wildfires erupted in California, Elon Musk used his X pulpit to claim “DEI means people DIE,” while others took aim at Karen Bass , the first woman and second black person to serve as Los Angeles mayor.
Conservatives likewise blamed Kristin Crowley , the city's first woman and openly gay fire chief, for the wildfires that killed 28 people.
Other incidents have also been linked to DEI initiatives.
Rep. Dan Meuser told Fox News that the New Orleans' New Years Day tragedy was because “the priority of the last four years has been DEI, not IEDs.”
And Phil Lyman , the one-time Maryland gubernatorial hopeful, blamed the Baltimore Key Brdieg disaster on “governors who prioritize diversity.” .

# UK to target AI child sex abuse tools in world first legal crackdown | CNN.
London Reuters — .
Britain will make it illegal to use artificial intelligence tools that create child sexual abuse images, it said on Saturday, becoming the first country in the world to introduce the new AI sexual abuse offenses.
Possessing, taking, making, showing or distributing explicit images of children is a crime in England and Wales.
The new offenses target the use of AI tools to “nudeify” real-life images of children.
The move comes as online criminals increasingly use AI to create child abuse material, with reports of such explicit images rising nearly five-fold in 2024, according to the Internet Watch Foundation.
“We know that sick predators' activities online often lead to them carrying out the most horrific abuse in person,” said Yvette Cooper, the United Kingdom's interior minister.
“It is vital that we tackle child sexual abuse online as well as offline so we can better protect the public from new and emerging crimes.”.
Predators also use AI tools to disguise their identity and blackmail children with fake images to force them into further abuse, such as by streaming live images, the government said.
The new criminal offenses include the possession, creation or distribution of AI tools designed to create child sexual abuse material and the possession of so-called AI “pedophile manuals,” which provide instructions on the usage of the technology.
Another specific offense will target those who run websites on which child sexual abuse content is distributed.
The government will also enable authorities to unlock digital devices for inspection.
The measures will be included in the Crime and Policing Bill when it comes to parliament.
Britain said earlier this month it would also make the creation and sharing of sexually explicit “deepfakes” - videos, pictures or audio clips made with AI to look real - a criminal offense.

Title: Karla Sofía Gascón says she will not withdraw from Oscar contention over past comments: 'I have not committed any crime' | CNN
# Karla Sofía Gascón says she will not withdraw from Oscar contention over past comments: 'I have not committed any crime' | CNN.
CNN — .
Oscar nominee Karla Sofía Gascón, the star of “Emilia Pérez,” is staying in the race for best actress despite controversy over offensive social media posts .
In an interview with CNN's Juan Carlos Arciniegas, Gascón, who made history last month as the first openly transgender actress nominated for an Oscar in an acting category, once again offered her “most sincere apologies to all the people who may have felt offended.”.
“I cannot step down from an Oscar nomination because I have not committed any crime nor have I harmed anyone.
I am neither racist nor anything that all these people have tried to make others believe I am,” Gascón told CNN.
The controversy arose after journalist Sarah Hagi shared screenshots of Gascón's old social media posts, in which she was critical of Muslim culture, the death of George Floyd and the direction of the Oscars.
Gascón, who deactivated her account on X following the controversy, apologized this week for her posts.
“I want to address the conversation around my past social media posts that have caused harm,” Gascón said in a statement shared with CNN.
“As a member of a marginalized community, I know this suffering all too well and deeply regret having caused pain.
All my life I have fought for a better world.
I believe that light will always triumph over darkness.”.
In one of the posts, originally written in Spanish, Gascón commented on the Floyd case, who died in 2020 after an encounter with police in Minneapolis.
“I really believe that very few ever cared about George Floyd, a scammer drug addict,” she wrote in part.
The actress also criticized the 2021 Oscars ceremony, held amid the Covid-19 pandemic.
“The #Oscars are increasingly resembling an independent and vindicative film awards ceremony, I didn't know if I was watching an Afro-Korean festival, a Black Lives Matter demonstration, or March 8th,” she posted at the time.
In her interview with CNN, Gascón said she didn't “recognize” some of the posts that have resurfaced.
“I have been judged, condemned, sacrificed, crucified, and stoned without a trial and without the option to defend myself,” Gascón said.
She denied writing a since-deleted 2022 tweet in which Selena Gomez, her co-star in “Emilia Pérez,” was described derogatorily.
“It's not mine, of course, I have never said anything about my colleague, I would never refer to her that way,” Gascón said.
Gascón is nominated for an Oscar for best actress for her role in “Emilia Pérez,” a Netflix musical and crime drama that tells the story of a Mexican drug trafficker seeking gender reassignment surgery, which has also generated much controversy, especially in Mexico.
Jacques Audiard, the French director of “Emilia Pérez,” defended the film in an interview with CNN en Español in January, saying, “If there are things that seem scandalous to Mexicans in 'Emilia,' I apologize.” .

# Best red carpet looks at the 2025 Grammys | CNN.
CNN — .
The Grammy Awards are renowned for outlandish fashion.
But on a night of tributes to first responders and victims of LA's recent wildfires, many guests struck a comparatively restrained note at the Crypto.com arena on Sunday.
The all-black trend seen at recent award ceremonies was embraced by everyone from Miley Cyrus (in a cut-out leather Saint Laurent dress) to Olivia Rodrigo (in a slinky halter neck Versace number).
Lady Gaga set a somber tone in a dramatic long-sleeved ball gown by Vivienne Westwood, though some attendees took a more light-hearted approach, whether it was J Balvin's long silk Dior Men coat or the sailor hat Billie Eilish wore with her Prada suit.
Guests also showed their support for LA — which has hosted the Grammys more times than any other city in its 66-year history — by wearing blue heart pins.
Brittany Howard, Jaden Smith and Jacob Collier were among those seen sporting the pins in support of MusiCares, a charity raising money for music industry professionals impacted by the fires.
Elsewhere, several of the evening's most anticipated arrivals used feathers to add volume or definition to their outfits.
Sabrina Carpenter wowed in a custom JW Anderson gown with elegant accents, while the beads and sequins of Cardi B's Roberto Cavalli Couture mermaid gown turned into an autumnal plume as it trailed to the floor.
Meanwhile, Charli XCX and Chappell Roan, who were among the night's most nominated artists, achieved similarly eye-catching effects with ruffles and cascading tulle.
It was perhaps no surprise that both gowns were by the same designer, Jean Paul Gaultier, albeit from very different eras: Charli XCX's outfit was a custom look from the Spring-Summer 2025 runway, while Roan opted for an archive piece from Gaultier's Spring 2003 couture collection.
And this wouldn't be the Grammy's without a bit of skin — or the illusion of it.
The various takes on nude ranged from the subtle (see Madison Beer's divine strapless gown and the sheer detailing of Shakira's Etro dress) to the not-so-subtle.
Ye's wife Bianca Censori left little to the imagination, shocking onlookers by dropping her coat to reveal a see-through slip dress that was, in every sense, barely there.
See below for some of the event's best and boldest looks.
This story will be updated throughout the evening.

Title: Education Department employees placed on paid leave as part of Trump administration's DEI purge | CNN Politics
# Education Department employees placed on paid leave as part of Trump administration's DEI purge | CNN Politics.
CNN — .
Dozens of employees at the Education Department were placed on paid administrative leave Friday as part of the Trump administration's larger effort to rid the federal workforce of employees associated with diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility efforts, two sources familiar with the move told CNN.
The department sent letters to employees informing them that their email accounts were being suspended but that they would continue to receive paychecks for an indefinite period, the sources said.
The department cited guidance from the White House's Office of Personnel and Management, issued on January 21, that directed government agencies to notify “all employees of DEIA offices that they are being placed on paid administrative leave effective immediately as the agency takes steps to close/end all DEIA initiatives, offices and programs.” .
The agency is the latest to face upheaval amid the White House's efforts to weed out DEI programs within the government and reshape the federal workforce in President Donald Trump's image.
At least 55 Education Department employees, including senior-level career workers who have served at the agency for decades, were notified Friday night that they'd been placed on paid leave, according to the American Federation of Government Employees, the union representing the agency's career officials.
“Effective January 31, 2025, you will be placed on administrative leave with full pay and benefits pursuant to the President's executive order on DEIA and further guidance from OPM,” the letter says, according to a copy obtained by CNN.
“This administrative leave is not being done for any disciplinary purpose.”.
According to the union, these employees do not hold job titles nor official duties related to DEIA, but they included staffers such as civil rights attorneys who handle student discrimination and antisemitism complaints; an employee working in a grant office; and a member of the artificial intelligence team helping the department understand AI in education.
But Sheria Smith, union president for Department of Education career employees, told CNN the employees placed on paid leave had attended a two-day diversity training seminar in 2019 during the first Trump administration “that was required for senior-level employees and strongly encouraged for others,” as well as similar training under the Biden administration.
Others affected had either participated in a one-day lunch training on DEI or had volunteered with an agency group or committee that plans programs such as Black History Month celebrations.
The diversity training for Education Department employees was encouraged during the first Trump administration under then-Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, whose goal was for 400 employees to attend the sessions, according to the union.
Because of the large participation in the 2019 training seminar, the union is worried that hundreds more Department of Education staffers could be affected.
“We've filed several requests for information with the agency to get a clear understanding of what's happening and how many employees overall will be impacted,” Smith told CNN, but the union has not received any additional information.
CNN reached out to the Department of Education for comment but did not receive a response.
The New York Times first reported on the letters sent to Education Department employees informing them that they were being put on paid administrative leave.
The White House last month ordered government DEI employees to be placed on administrative leave and ended the use of DEI in hiring and federal contracting.
“The mission of the agency is stalled because this administration has forced these people to stop performing work for the American people,” Smith told CNN.
Agency leaders were also instructed to ask employees to report any efforts to “disguise these programs” in federal jobs and contract descriptions since the November election.

New York CNN — .
The DeepSeek drama may have been briefly eclipsed by, you know, everything in Washington (which, if you can believe it, got even crazier Wednesday).
But rest assured that over in Silicon Valley , there has been nonstop, Olympic-level pearl-clutching over this Chinese upstart that managed to singlehandedly wipe out hundreds of billions of dollars in market cap in just a few hours and put America's mighty tech titans on their heels.
ICYMI: DeepSeek is a Chinese AI lab with a model that's similar to ChatGPT, and people are freaking out over it because of its engineers' claims about how they built it — cheaply, using a small fraction of the computing power used by US labs like OpenAI.
Big picture: DeepSeek has forced tech bros and their investors to question the industry's core assumption that they need gajillions more dollars to effectively secure enough energy to power their AI advancements.
Now, perhaps not unexpectedly, American tech leaders are trying to shift the narrative to make DeepSeek look like the villain. (And you gotta suspect none of these guys — they're mostly guys — paid attention in English class because they appear fully unaware of the excruciating irony — some might say hypocrisy — baked into their accusations.) .
On Tuesday, Bloomberg and the Financial Times reported that OpenAI and Microsoft, its biggest investor, are looking into evidence that DeepSeek used OpenAI's intellectual property to build its competitor, violating its terms of service.
An OpenAI spokesperson confirmed to CNN on Wednesday that the company is “aware of and reviewing indications that DeepSeek may have inappropriately distilled our models, and will share information as we know more.” .
“Distilling” isn't exactly stealing , but it is a kind of copycat maneuver used by developers to train smaller AI models on the performance of larger, more sophisticated ones. (More on that in a moment.) .
CNN One Thing Trump's 'America First' Agenda Meets China's AI Advancement Wall Steet, Washington, and Silicon Valley are scrambling after a little-known Chinese startup claimed its artificial intelligence model can operate like ChatGPT at just a fraction of the cost.
We examine why the breakthrough could reverberate beyond the tech sector as President Donald Trump looks to counter China's influence.

...
So, to recap: OpenAI, a startup that's built on a foundation of data it scraped from the internet without permission , is pointing the finger at another startup allegedly doing… more or less the same thing.
As a reminder, OpenAI is currently mired in litigation with various content creators, including the New York Times , who accuse the company of training its large language models on copyrighted material. (OpenAI doesn't deny using the material but has argued that it's not copyright infringement because the content falls under the legal doctrine known as “fair use.”) .
The irony might have been best summed up in a headline from tech news site 404 Media: “OpenAI Furious DeepSeek Might Have Stolen All the Data OpenAI Stole From Us.” .
Some prominent tech figures greeted the allegations from OpenAI with a shrug, noting that distilling is practically standard practice in the AI industry.
“I'd be surprised if DeepSeek hadn't used it,” said Lutz Finger, senior visiting lecturer at Cornell University.
“Technically, it's easy to do,” he added, and “if done well, it is easy to disguise and avoid detection, thus I would be equally surprised if we ever get proof of such tactics.”.
Tech venture capitalist Bill Gurley wrote on X that “the core algorithm everyone uses was developed at DeepMind,” Google's AI lab.
“No one disputes that.
The vast majority of LLM insights and breakthroughs are 'borrowed.'
”.
So yeah, maybe OpenAI is having a bit of a sour grapes moment over a foreign rival making it look bad on the global stage.
Whatever.
The more generous read is that OpenAI, as the poster child of American AI innovation, is trying to establish some rules in what is an unregulated and rapidly expanding industry that few people outside of it understand at a technical level.
For example, there is a fine line between “distillation” and “extraction,” explains Zack Kass, an AI consultant and former OpenAI go-to-market lead.
“Distillation is a common practice in AI, but it's typically done within the same organization that owns both models,” he said in an email.
“If DeepSeek trained its model by querying ChatGPT at scale and using the responses to teach its own model, it raises legitimate concerns about whether that constitutes unauthorized use of OpenAI's API,” Kass said.
“Regardless of the specifics here, we're entering a phase where the AI community will have to define clearer norms around what constitutes fair use versus unauthorized replication.”.

CNN — .
Like most of us, Earth has a lot going on under the surface — even in what may have once seemed to be its most unassuming layer.
The mantle, a zone between our planet's thin crust and the molten core, features 1,800 miles (2,900 kilometers) of mostly solid rock, with a consistency like thickened caramel that scientists long hypothesized was uniformly blended.
But massive unmixed regions have been found lingering in the mantle, like lumps of chocolate in a cookie, and new findings are just beginning to reveal their secrets.
Among the enigmatic mantle lumps are two enormous “supercontinents” buried thousands of kilometers below the crust amid the remains of ancient tectonic plates.
One supercontinent lies under Africa, and the other resides deep under the Pacific Ocean.
Using a new method to analyze data from earthquakes, researchers recently uncovered previously unknown details about these vast island regions, revealing that they may serve as anchors in our planet's mantle and that they could be much older than previously thought.
The discovery adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that the rocky mantle isn't as well-stirred by Earth's internal churning as once believed.
And hidden structures or pockets of unblended material, such as these supercontinents, may shape mantle activity, including plate movement, in ways that are yet to be understood, scientists reported January 22 in the journal Nature .
“These findings will contribute to a better understanding of mantle convection and plate tectonics, and, therefore, phenomena we experience at the surface like earthquakes and volcanism,” said Claire Richardson , a doctoral candidate in the School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University, who was not involved in the new research.
“Resolving the physical, thermal, and chemical properties of rocks ~3000 km (1,864 miles) below our feet, at extreme temperatures and pressures, is a challenging problem to say the least,” Richardson told CNN in an email.
“Open questions abound, and each new study gets us closer to understanding what's really going on down there.”.
Researchers first spotted the subterranean supercontinents about 50 years ago when they popped up as anomalies in seismic data generated by earthquakes powerful enough to send reverberations through the planet.
When seismic waves encounter unusual structures in the mantle, changes in wave speed provide seismologists with clues about Earth's deep interior.
Over the decades, seismic data revealed that these supercontinents make up about 20% of the mantle-core boundary.
Each of the buried islands covers hundreds of thousands of miles, and in some spots they tower nearly 600 miles (965 kilometers) tall.
However, little was known about what they were made of, when they sank and what role they might play in mantle flow, known as convection, said Dr. Sujania Talavera-Soza , lead author of the new study and a geosciences and seismology researcher at Utrecht University in the Netherlands.
“Their origin and whether they are long-lived structures — it's widely debated,” Talavera-Soza said.
Earlier research focused on the velocity of seismic waves, showing that wave speed slowed by about 2% upon arriving at the supercontinents.
This slowing of seismic waves led geologists to name the regions large low shear velocity provinces, or LLSVPs.
Velocity loss in seismic waves suggested that these mantle zones were hotter than the rocks around them, Talavera-Soza said.
But it was unknown whether the LLSVPs differed structurally from nearby regions.
Scientists were also uncertain whether the supercontinents were actively involved in convection, or if they were “kind of dense piles that would just be sitting there,” said study coauthor Dr. Arwen Deuss , a professor of structure and composition of Earth's deep interior at Utrecht University.
“There was no information about that,” Deuss said.
“We only knew that seismic waves slowed down.”.
In the new study, the authors used a different approach for studying the LLSVPs to see if they could tease out details about the zones' composition and activity.
They looked at the attenuation, or intensity, of seismic signals as they traveled through the mantle to see how much energy the vibrations from quakes lost.
In music, attenuation is comparable to damping a tone, which produces a lower volume, Deuss said.
Examining the attenuation of the waves — along with changes in wave speed — could provide previously unseen clues about LLSVPs' makeup.
The best data for this is from waves produced by earthquakes that are magnitude 7.8 or higher, Talavera-Soza added.
Wave speed and energy loss were known to be affected by mineral grain size as well as temperature, so the authors used a physics model that linked seismology and mineral physics.
Waves are damped more when they encounter material made of smaller grains; if lots of grains are packed together, there are more boundaries between the grains that can sap a wave's energy.
Other studies revealed that the supercontinents had company in the deep mantle.
Around them were “ slab graveyards ” of sunken tectonic plates, Deuss said.
They were cooler than the LLSVPs, so seismic waves moved through them more quickly.
However, the new model showed that while seismic waves' velocity dipped when they reached LLSVPs, the waves didn't lose much energy.
By comparison, there was significant damping among the cooler graveyards around the LLSVPs.
Researchers believe those differences come down to the comparative ages of the structures.
Over millions of years, as rocky material descends through the boundary between the upper and lower mantle, mineral crystals are compressed and reformed into tinier grains that then regrow over time.
Younger regions therefore have smaller crystals, which suck more energy from seismic waves, so the amount of damping in a region hints at how old it is.
“The fact that the LLSVPs show very little damping, means that they must consist of much larger grains than their surroundings,” Talavera-Soza said.
Larger mineral grains suggested that the supercontinents were significantly older than the tectonic graveyards around them, as their grains must have had more time to grow, according to the study.
Larger building blocks would also make the supercontinents more rigid, keeping them separate from mantle convection, or movement of materials in that layer due to heat transfer.
“Our study points to the LLSVPs being long-lived features, at least half a billion years old, perhaps even older,” Talavera-Soza said.
“This implies they act as anchors at the base of the core-mantle boundary and have survived mantle convection, meaning that the mantle is not well-mixed.”.
This discovery follows another recent revelation about even more “sunken worlds” that contradict the notion of a blended mantle.
Buried plates in tectonic graveyards tend to accumulate in alignment with Earth's subduction zones — regions where the edges of two plates meet, and where one slides beneath the other.
But earlier this year, another team of scientists identified sunken tectonic slabs far from these boundaries in locations under continents' interiors and beneath oceans, where sunken plates had never been found before.
“Apparently, such zones in the Earth's mantle are much more widespread than previously thought,” said Thomas Schouten , lead author of that investigation and a researcher at the Geological Institute of ETH Zurich, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, in a statement .
The model in the new study — the first 3D attenuation model for the entire mantle — will help seismologists to better understand what lies thousands of kilometers below Earth's surface, said Richardson, the doctoral candidate.
“It maps regions of the Earth that weaken seismic energy, ultimately affecting the measurements many seismologists use to understand other physical and chemical properties of Earth's interior,” she said.
The findings could transform researchers' understanding of plate tectonics and how plate movement might be shaped by these ancient, fixed anchors near Earth's core, Deuss said.
Further analysis of the supercontinents could also reveal if they are the source of geochemical elements nearly as old as Earth itself that are found in lava from certain types of volcanoes, she added.
“These LLSVPs have been there for a long time — if they've been there for a billion years, they might have also been there for 4 billion years.
They might well be that hidden reservoir where these chemical primordial elements might be located.
We can't prove that now, but geochemists can investigate this,” Deuss said.
“From this study, I think there will be a lot of extra research that might answer a lot of outstanding questions that have been confusing scientists for ages.”.

Title: Chuck Todd is leaving NBC | CNN Business
# Chuck Todd is leaving NBC | CNN Business.
CNN — .
Chuck Todd, former moderator of NBC's “Meet the Press,” is leaving the network after nearly 20 years.
In an internal memo on Friday, Todd thanked his longtime colleagues and said he has a “few new projects” in the works, signaling a desire for a more entrepreneurial phase of his career.
For that reason, he said he is leaving the network a number of months before his NBC contract was set to expire.
Todd said NBC is allowing him to take his twice-a-week podcast franchise, “The ChuckToddcast,” to a new distributor.
For about a decade, Todd was one of the most prominent voices at NBC News, covering the political rise of Donald Trump and the Democratic response.
He helmed “Meet the Press” from 2014 until 2023.
Todd was outspoken about the corrosive impacts of Trump-era lies and indecency — and was ridiculed by Trump and others for it.
In 2023, after a management change atop NBC News, Todd stepped down from “Meet the Press” and Kristen Welker took over his role.
Todd said it was important not to “overstay” his welcome — a striking message for a Washington crowd full of elderly politicos.
“I'd rather leave a little bit too soon than stay a tad too long,” he added.
Todd saw his air time diminished in recent years, though he remained a prominent part of political and Election Night coverage last November.
In a statement on Friday NBC News said, “We're grateful for Chuck's many contributions to our political coverage during his nearly two-decade career at NBC News and for his deep commitment to 'Meet the Press' and its enduring legacy.
We wish him all the best in his next endeavors.”.
In his memo, Todd said, “The media has a lot of work to do to win back the trust of viewers/listeners/readers and I'm convinced the best place to start is from the bottom up,” with local instead of national media.
“This is a ripe moment,” he added.
“The only way to fix this information ecosystem is to stop whining about the various ways the social media companies are manipulating things and instead roll up our collective sleeves and start with local.”.

Title: Trump said he hadn't read Project 2025 - but most of his early executive orders overlap with its proposals | CNN Politics
# Trump said he hadn't read Project 2025 - but most of his early executive orders overlap with its proposals | CNN Politics.
CNN — .
President Donald Trump caught his own administration off guard last week by suggesting that the nation's primary disaster response agency might simply “go away.” .
Though Trump had routinely lambasted the Federal Emergency Management Agency throughout his third White House bid, he had stopped short of calling for its elimination.
Now, an executive order bearing his signature has put that possibility in motion.
The idea, however, wasn't new.
The contours of it circulated nearly two years ago through Project 2025, a sweeping plan to overhaul the government that Trump as a candidate forcefully disavowed.
Many of Trump's early actions appear closely aligned with Project 2025's plans.
A CNN analysis of the 53 executive orders and actions from Trump's first week in office found that more than two-thirds - 36 - evoke proposals outlined in “Mandate for Leadership,” Project 2025's 922-page blueprint for the next Republican president.
The overlap includes early steps taken by Trump to execute some of his most-touted pledges: cracking down on illegal immigration; dismantling diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives; and rolling back environmental restrictions on oil and gas exploration.
But the framework offered in “Mandate for Leadership” also foreshadowed some of Trump's more provocative and less expected early actions.
It calls for “quickly and aggressively” punishing countries that refuse deported migrants - as Trump did Sunday when Colombia blocked two US military planes carrying deportees.
It advises the president to “immediately revoke the security clearance” of top national security officials accused by conservatives of political bias, a move Trump executed within hours of taking office.
And Trump's directive to curb foreign aid from countries “not fully aligned” with his global aims appeases Project 2025's concern that these programs are “disconnected from the strategy and practice of U.S. foreign policy.”.
“This is exactly the work we set out to do,” Paul Dans, who oversaw Project 2025 at the conservative Heritage Foundation, told CNN in an interview Wednesday.
“It's still in the early first stages of bearing fruit, but we wanted to make sure the president was ready to hit the ground running on day one.
The rapidity and the depth of what they've rolled out this quickly is a testament to the work done in Project 2025 and other presidential transition projects.”.
The fraction of executive actions that so far do not touch on Project 2025 priorities include some of Trump's narrower fixations, like declassifying records on the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, requiring federal workers to return to the office and demanding the flag fly at full staff during presidential inaugurations.
In a statement to CNN, the White House picked up where Trump's campaign left off downplaying any connection between the Republican leader and the conservative playbook.
The president, his spokesman Harrison Fields said, “had nothing to do with Project 2025.” .
“In his first few days in office, President Trump has delivered on the promises that earned him a resounding mandate from the American people - securing the border, restoring common sense, driving down inflation, and unleashing American energy,” Fields said.
The Heritage Foundation declined to comment. .
Think tanks and advocacy organizations from both sides of the aisle typically prepare for incoming administrations with ready-made policy proposals.
But Project 2025 was significant for its breadth and coordination across the conservative movement.
The Heritage Foundation has found success influencing Republican administrations “through the back channels where a lot of Washington work happens” going back to President Ronald Reagan, said Heath Brown, a City University of New York professor who's written multiple books on presidential transitions.
The organization once boasted that Trump during his first year as president had implemented 64 percent of the 334 policies recommended in the 2016 version of “Mandate for Leadership.”
As Trump prepared for a third White House bid, he set the stage for Heritage's seminal work to inform his next administration's priorities once again.
“They're going to lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do,” Trump said during an April 2022 keynote address to the organization first unearthed by the Washington Pos t.
At least 140 former Trump administration officials and dozens of ardent allies ultimately wrote and contributed to “Mandate for Leadership.”
More than 100 friendly organizations endorsed it.
But by mid-2024, with Democrats seizing on Project 2025's more controversial proposals, Trump furiously sought to distance himself from what would become a deeply unpopular manifesto.
“I have nothing to do with Project 2025,” Trump said in the opening moments of his September debate against Vice President Kamala Harris.
“That's out there.
I haven't read it.
I don't want to read it, purposely.
I'm not going to read it.”.
Since his November victory, though, Trump has filled key government posts with people who helped put Project 2025 together.
Both Tom Homan, who is serving as White House border czar, and Trump's new CIA Director John Ratcliffe contributed to “Mandate for Leadership.”
Brendan Carr, named chairman of the Federal Communications Commission by Trump, wrote an entire chapter for Project 2025 on the agency he now leads.
Russ Vought, chosen as director of the Office of Management and Budget, authored a section on presidential power that appeared to preview the freeze on federal spending put in place this week by Trump's young government.
The president, Vought wrote for Project 2025, “should use every possible tool to propose and impose fiscal discipline on the federal government.
Anything short of that would constitute abject failure.”.
Dans, who stepped down from his position in July amid intensifying criticism of Project 2025 from Trump, said the first week of Trump's new term has been “gratifying” to watch.
He called the Democratic Party's “obsession” with Project 2025 - the subject of tens of millions of dollars in negative ads during the presidential race - an “epic electoral fail.”.
Democrats, though, continue to attack Trump over his ties to the conservative blueprint.
Since the election, the Democratic National Committee has sent more than 50 press releases that included the term “Project 2025.”.
Some of the synergy between Trump's early movements and Project 2025 reflect the expected harmony of a new Republican administration and a supportive right-wing group.
Indeed, a considerable share of the manifesto's voluminous policy plans are anchored in two consistent themes: unravel Joe Biden's presidency wherever possible and return to the policies of Trump's first term.
In Trump's first executive order after taking office, he revoked 67 of Biden's executive orders - including at least 15 singled out in “Mandate for Leadership.”.
Meanwhile, reinstating his first-term border policies - such as blocking federal grants to cities that don't comply with immigration enforcement - satisfied some of Project 2025's own immigration prescriptions.
But Trump also moved to restrict temporary protected status for those fleeing humanitarian emergencies, paused disbursements to non-profits assisting undocumented immigrants and mobilized the military to assist in border enforcement - all policies pushed by Project 2025.
“This is not a continuation of the first Trump administration.
It is substantially more aggressive, and he's doing a lot of the things we complained he didn't do in the first term,” said Ken Cuccinelli, the acting deputy secretary for the Department of Homeland Security under Trump who authored the Project 2025 section on his former agency.
The “general aggressiveness is certainly consistent” with what Cuccinelli wrote in Project 2025, he added, pointing especially to the deployment of the military and Trump's use of Department of Justice officers to assist in deportation.
As for FEMA, Cuccinelli in “Mandate for Leadership” urged the new administration to “shift the majority of preparedness and response costs to states and localities.”
The language is recognizable in the proposal Trump floated recently while touring North Carolina flood damage: “We're going to recommend that FEMA go away and we pay directly, we pay a percentage, to the state, and the state should fix it.”.
In his ensuing executive order, Trump launched a commission to review changes to FEMA, including whether the agency should be reformed to function only as a “support agency” to the states.
Michael Coen, a former FEMA chief of staff during the Obama and Biden administrations, said that while he had seen the Project 2025 proposal for the agency, it surprised him to hear Trump vocalize it.
“I never imagined it would be something that he would openly talk about,” Coen said.
“It does seem like there are people in the president's ear that are pushing what is in Project 2025 as far as their plan for FEMA.”.
Cuccinelli acknowledged he also hadn't expected Trump to embrace his proposal on FEMA.
In his first term, Trump relished his power awarding emergency relief to disaster-stricken areas.
“President Trump does love to show up and write checks, but I give him a lot of credit,” Cuccinelli said.
“He clearly recognizes that FEMA as a concept is failing.”.
Coen expects Republican governors and local officials will push back against this worldview.
“States across the country have come to rely on the federal government,” Coen said.
“It's hard to budget for if you're going to get a 500-year rain event that's going to wash away a town, and wash away your critical infrastructure.”.
Trump previewed many of his opening movements as president more than a year ago in a series of policy proposals published on a campaign website called “Agenda47,” such as ending subsidies for electric vehicles, limiting refugee programs and restoring a first-term directive allowing him to remove federal workers deemed insufficiently loyal.
Those ideas were separately backed by Project 2025's authors.
Trump's campaign website made clear he intended to reopen Alaska to drilling - which he did on his first day as president.
Project 2025 endorsed not only the move, but also the urgency.
“Alaska is a special case and deserves immediate action,” one section said.
Some of Project 2025's other priorities have been achieved indirectly through Trump's actions.
For example, a pending plan by the Biden administration for a ground and surface water limit on toxic PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, was withdrawn under Trump's day one freeze on new regulations.
A section on the Environmental Protection Agency in “Mandate for Leadership” encouraged the new president to “revisit the designation of PFAS chemicals as 'hazardous substances.'”.
Groups that had pushed for the Biden administration to crack down on PFAS - known as “forever chemicals” because they don't degrade in the environment - were well aware of the target placed on those regulations by Project 2025, said Melanie Benesh, vice president of governmental affairs at the Environmental Working Group.
There was some reason for optimism, Benesh acknowledged, when Lee Zeldin, Trump's EPA administrator, touted his past work tackling PFAS during his confirmation hearing.
But that hope dissipated when Trump's executive order effectively stalled Biden's planned crackdown.
“It calls into question the incoming administrator's commitment to taking on PFAS,” Benesh told CNN.
EPA spokeswoman Molly Vaseliou said it was “common transition procedure” to hold pending regulations when a new administration comes in.
“President Trump advanced conservation and environmental stewardship while promoting economic growth for families across the country in his first term and will continue to do so this term,” Vaseliou said.
As the administration moves forward, the extent to which Trump's actions run parallel to Project 2025 will remain a central question.
Some of Trump's early executive orders appear to lay the groundwork for future actions advocated by Project 2025.
For example, Trump's national energy emergency calls for a review of regulations protecting endangered and marine wildlife that may be “obstacles to domestic energy infrastructure.”
Project 2025 suggests the new administration move immediately to lift protections on grizzly bears and gray wolves and work with Congress on an overhaul of the Endangered Species Act.
Elsewhere, Trump has taken steps that seem to go beyond what Project 2025 has proposed.
Nowhere in the dozens of pages dedicated to a forceful crackdown on immigration do “Mandate for Leadership” authors suggest declaring the US is under invasion and designating Mexican drug cartels as terrorist groups, as Trump did in his executive orders.
Similarly, Trump exceeded Project 2025's calls to restart federal executions with an executive order expanding the potential crimes that could trigger the death penalty.
Still, not all of Project 2025's plans are necessarily included in the public manifesto.
The project's website acknowledged it intended to deliver the Trump transition a “playbook of actions” for the administration's first 180 days.
Neither Heritage nor the Trump White House would say if that exchange took place.
And in a hidden-camera video of Vought released last year , he said his group was drafting hundreds of potential orders, regulations and memos for Trump.
“With immigration in particular, executive orders aren't necessarily the thing that makes policy change,” said Dara Lind, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, an advocacy group for immigrants.
“What's been notable from the first nine days or so is not just that they had the executive orders ready to go on day one,” but other technical regulations and declarations on hand as well.
“That kind of timeline indicates a certain amount of preparation before getting into office,” she said.
Dans noted Project 2025 also engaged in a nationwide search for Trump loyalists to fill federal agencies with people who would execute his agenda.
“It all comes down to implementation,” Dans said, “And Project 2025 was ultimately about putting in place the people who would come in from outside the swamp and make changes.”.
On at least one issue, Trump is already spurning Project 2025: the future of TikTok.
Trump in an executive order paused a ban on the Chinese social media app, which Project 2025 described as a national security imperative.
Trump also recently said he was “ very unlikely ” to limit abortion pill access.
Project 2025 not only pushes for the administration to reverse federal approval of the abortion pill mifepristone, it also proposes excluding the morning-after pill and men's contraceptives from coverage mandated under the Affordable Care Act.
Trump has, though, moved to restrict federal funding for abortions both domestically and abroad, a stance that also appears in Project 2025's policy framework.
And his nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., told a Senate hearing Wednesday that Trump asked him to “study the safety” of mifepristone.
CNN's review of Trump's executive actions covered the first week of his new term, from his swearing in until noon on Monday.
In the days since, he has remained active, restricting certain treatments for transgender minors, keeping transgender adults out of the military and reinstating servicemembers who were discharged for refusing COVID vaccinations.
Each of those moves had support in Project 2025.

# Tech giants ramp up the battle against online hate speech in Europe.
At home, some are pulling back | CNN Business.
New York CNN — .
Two of America's Big Tech companies are opening the door to more “free expression,” even if it means more hateful content.
But in Europe, Big Tech companies are voluntarily cracking down.
It's a reminder of just how divergent Europeans' and Americans' online experiences are becoming, as EU lawmakers forge ahead with tech safety and accountability legislation against an industry widely seen as too big and too out of control, while such proposals have languished, if not faced active resistance, on Capitol Hill.
Tech platforms including Meta's Facebook and Instagram, X, Snapchat, TikTok, Twitch, LinkedIn and YouTube this week signed onto an updated European Union code of conduct promising to do more to combat online hate speech, which is often illegal in European countries.
Meanwhile, two of those same platforms — Meta and X — have made changes in the United States that they acknowledge could usher in more hateful speech, arguing that such changes promote freedom of speech and combat censorship.
And across the industry, companies have shrunk teams whose entire job was to ensure the safety of their platforms, including from people who seek to foment hate and violence.
The contrast is striking.
As part of the EU agreement, the companies agree to allow “monitoring reporters” — non-profits or public organizations with expertise on hate speech — to review their platforms and to act quickly on most of the content they flag, the European Commission said Monday.
The new code of conduct is voluntary, but tech companies can use their compliance to demonstrate that they are meeting obligations legally required by the EU's Digital Services Act (DSA) , which, among other things, mandates Big Tech platforms take meaningful steps to reduce illegal and harmful content.
“In Europe there is no place for illegal hate, either offline or online,” Henna Virkkunen, the commission's executive vice president for tech sovereignty, security and democracy, said in a statement, adding that the commitments will help “ensure a safe digital space for all.”.
It's one of a number of differences in US versus EU tech users' online experiences that have accumulated over time, Isabelle Wright, director of technology and society at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, told CNN.
“I think we've been heading in this direction for a while, but not just for hate speech, I think really for all categories of harm that most (other) Western nations cover in in their tech regulation,” Wright said.
“It's going to lead to an incredibly fractured information ecosystem between the US and essentially every other Western democracy.”.
Meta and X did not respond to requests for comment.
To be sure, Silicon Valley's efforts have always been far from perfect.
Meta's platforms have been accused of playing a key role in the organization of the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol and abetting genocide in Myanmar.
And across the tech world, efforts to address harmful content like hate speech have always been targeted, at least to some extent, at placating advertisers obsessed with “brand safety,” terrified at the thought that their ads could be placed next to a comment section awash in inflammatory remarks and threats of violence.
With advertising being the prime revenue generator for social media companies, the tastes of advertisers has historically set the tone.
But now even those efforts have been scaled back in the United States.
Elon Musk-owned X has seen an uptick in hate speech in recent years as it welcomed previously banned White supremacists and conspiracy peddlers back to the platform.
Musk himself has also boosted racist conspiracies on the site.
And Meta earlier this month announced several major content moderation policy changes in the United States, including scaling back its automated systems for removing content that violates its policies.
The systems will now be focused on checking only for illegal and “high-severity” violations such as terrorism and child sexual exploitation.
Meta also updated its hateful conduct policy to roll back protections for certain groups, including women and LGBTQ+ people.
Users of Meta's platforms will now, for example, be able to refer to women as household objects and suggest that transgender people are mentally ill, without fear that their comments will be removed or restricted by Facebook's moderation team. (A Meta spokesperson noted that the company would continue to prohibit slurs, as well as attacks against certain groups, such as those based on ethnicity, race and religion.).
Terms of Service with Clare Duffy How Do You Fact-Check Social Media?
Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg says the company is ending its partnership with third-party fact-checkers in the US because the program caused too much censorship on the company's platforms.
The announcement raised a big question: How much were third-party fact-checkers really responsible for what content stays or goes on Meta's platforms?

The platforms' US moves may reflect the changing American political environment, where many Republican leaders have equated content moderation with “censorship.” .
Members of the incoming Donald Trump administration, including the nominee to lead the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr, have also called for a reinterpretation of the tech immunity law Section 230.
In essence, they want tech companies to be protected from lawsuits over what their users post only if they do little-to-no content moderation whatsoever.
Following Meta's announcement earlier this month, Carr posted a gif of Jack Nicholson grinning and nodding in response to CNN's Brian Stelter post on X with the news about the tech giant's moderation policy.
When tech platforms announce changing policies or principles, Wright said, “the language they use to stand behind those indicates that they've put in, you know, a lot of a lot of thought and consultation into these processes.
Yet when an administration changes, those principles seem to change like the wind in order to better align with the people who could potentially regulate them or disrupt their businesses.”.
“I think what has become clear to the platforms is that the chances of any type of tech regulation in the US are slim to none,” Wright said.
But it isn't just hate speech where Americans have a different experience.
Europeans are protected in much broader ways, too.
Unlike Americans, Europeans are protected from having their personal demographic information, such as their race and political views, collected by tech companies without their consent, thanks to the General Data Protection Regulation .
Nor can Big Tech firms stop app developers from communicating cheaper, off-platform offers to users because of the Digital Markets Act .
The DSA also provides EU users with greater protections from targeted online ads.
And Europeans may have less access to AI tools, including products from Apple and Meta , because of privacy regulations and an EU law aimed at safe and responsible development of the technology.
But that divergence has the potential to become less pronounced as tech leaders have cozied up to Trump in the hopes that the new administration will advance their interests.
Zuckerberg and Musk, as well as Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and TikTok CEO Shou Chew, were all seated prominently at Trump's inauguration Monday.
Some of those Big Tech CEOs have already suggested they want Trump to pressure Europe into relaxing protections and regulations on the continent.
Cook is said to have raised the issue of European regulations in a meeting with Trump at Mar-a-Lago following the election.
And Zuckerberg has expressly said he will seek Trump's help in pushing back on safety rules from the EU and elsewhere.
In his policy announcement earlier this month, Zuckerberg said: “We're going to work with President Trump to push back on governments around the world that are going after American companies and pushing to censor more.”.

Title: Trump fires head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau | CNN Business
# Trump fires head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau | CNN Business.
New York CNN — .
President Donald Trump has fired Rohit Chopra, the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
Chopra received an email from the White House on Saturday morning informing him of the firing, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.
Chopra, who has been targeted by Republican lawmakers for putting restrictions on financial institutions in favor of consumers, announced his departure in a post on X on Saturday.
“This letter confirms that my term as CFPB Director has concluded.
I know the CFPB is ready to work with you and the next confirmed Director, and we have a great deal of energy to ensure continued success,” Chopra wrote .
The CFPB declined to comment on the news.
“It's the executive's decision and prerogative to see who they want in that role,” a White House official told CNN.
Major consumer banks including Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase are among companies facing lawsuits from the CFPB.
They, alongside tech industry leaders, have encouraged Trump to remove Chopra from his role — which was made possible by a 2020 Supreme Court ruling that enabled presidents to fire CFPB directors.
Chopra was appointed in 2021 by former President Joe Biden to serve as director of the bureau that regulates financial agencies.
The director of the CFPB, who under law was to serve a five-year term, also serves as a board member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, voting on key banking regulations.
Chopra will no longer be serving in that role either.
In his time at the CFPB, Chopra spearheaded controversial regulation limiting overdraft fees banks can charge as well as late fees credit card companies could collect from customers.
The rule intending to cap credit card late fees at $8 was later struck down by a federal judge.
The CFPB rule on overdraft fees, which would cap them at $5 — a substantial savings from the $35 that customers are typically charged — was finalized at the end of last year but is likely to face legal challenges , as well.
Under Chopra's leadership, the CFPB also finalized a rule making personal data more accessible so that it is easier to switch banks.
Before Trump took office this month, the agency finalized a rule that would remove about $49 billion in medical bills from credit reports.
“People who get sick shouldn't have their financial future upended,” said Chopra in a statement on January 7.
The consumer watchdog agency was created after the 2008 financial crisis by way of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.
The agency was the brainchild of Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who began advocating for it in 2007 when she was a Harvard Law School professor.
Warren, the ranking member of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, applauded Chopra for “holding Wall Street accountable for cheating hard-working families,” she said Saturday in a statement.
Despite their differences with Trump, Warren and several progressive lawmakers, including Sen. Bernie Sanders, have signaled their support for the president's campaign promise to temporarily cap credit interest rates at 10% — less than half of current rates according to Federal Reserve data.
To fulfill this promise, Warren said Trump “needs a strong CFPB and a strong CFPB director,” adding that “if President Trump and Republicans decide to cower to Wall Street billionaires and destroy the agency, they will have a fight on their hands.”.

Title: Trump's FCC is investigating NPR and PBS stations over sponsorships | CNN Business
# Trump's FCC is investigating NPR and PBS stations over sponsorships | CNN Business.
CNN — .
Brendan Carr, the Federal Communications Commission's new chairman, on Wednesday ordered an investigation into the sponsorship practices of NPR and PBS member stations.
In a letter obtained by CNN, Carr said he was “concerned that NPR and PBS broadcasts could be violating federal law by airing commercials.” .
“In particular, it is possible that NPR and PBS member stations are broadcasting underwriting announcements that cross the line into prohibited commercial advertisements,” Carr wrote in the letter, which was sent to NPR chief executive Katherine Maher and PBS president and chief executive Paula Kerger.
NPR and PBS programming is aired to a network of around 1,500 member stations, all of which choose which programs to broadcast.
The stations require licenses approved by the FCC to operate, and these licenses limit them as non-commercial educational broadcast stations, which are prohibited by federal law from airing advertisements.
The FCC's investigation will probe the underwriting announcements and policies of NPR and PBS, as well as their broadcast stations.
In a statement , Maher emphasized that the radio broadcaster and its member stations have complied with FCC regulations.
“We are confident any review of our programming and underwriting practices will confirm NPR's adherence to these rules,” Maher wrote.
PBS, likewise, defended its compliance with FCC standards, saying in a statement that it has worked “diligently to comply with the FCC's underwriting regulations.”.
Carr also sent the letter to congressional lawmakers, noting the investigation “may prove relevant to an ongoing legislative debate” over whether “to stop requiring taxpayers to subsidize NPR and PBS programming.”.
“To the extent that these taxpayer dollars are being used to support a for profit endeavor or an entity that is airing commercial advertisements, then that would further undermine any case for continuing to fund NPR and PBS with taxpayer dollars,” he wrote.
The investigation was first reported by the New York Times .
The FCC's probe echoes President Trump's attacks on news organizations whose reporting he takes issue with.
Last week, the FCC chair reversed eleventh-hour decisions from his predecessor, Jessica Rosenworcel, to dismiss complaints that had been brought against local CBS, ABC and NBC stations.
Notably, Rosenworcel also dismissed a complaint that had blocked a Philly-based Fox division's license renewal — a decision Carr did not reverse.
“We don't have the luxury of doing anything other than making very, very clear that this agency and its licensing authority should not be weaponized in a way that is fundamentally at odds with the First Amendment,” Rosenworcel wrote in a January 16 statement. .
Trump's ire against the press is nothing new — as part of his retaliation against those who he believes have wronged him .
On the campaign trail, he repeatedly took aim at news publishers.
For example, in March , Trump slapped ABC News and George Stephanopoulos with a lawsuit that the Disney-owned broadcaster eventually settled for $15 million .
And in November , Trump sued CBS over the network's “60 Minutes” interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris.
CNN's October review of Trump's speeches and social media posts found that over the past two years, he has called for every major American TV news network to be punished.
Just two days after reassuming the presidency, Trump took aim at MSNBC in a Truth Social post .
“MSDNC is even worse than CNN,” Trump wrote.
“They shouldn't even have a right to broadcast — Only in America.”.

Title: Women's college basketball greats Caitlin Clark and A'ja Wilson's collegiate jerseys retired | CNN
# Women's college basketball greats Caitlin Clark and A'ja Wilson's collegiate jerseys retired | CNN.
CNN — .
Caitlin Clark and A'ja Wilson , who both helped elevate the game of women's college basketball, had their respective No. 22 jersey retired Sunday at the schools where they became bona fide superstars.
Clark, the all-time leading scorer in NCAA men's and women's Division I basketball history, had her jersey raised to the rafters at Carver-Hawkeye Arena in Iowa City, Iowa, after the Iowa Hawkeyes' 76-69 upset win against the No. 4 USC Trojans.
Clark thanked her former teammates who were in attendance for the ceremony.
“I'm pretty overwhelmed right now,” the West Des Moines, Iowa, native told the sold-out crowd.
“I wouldn't be here without any of you and a lot of you came back.
You all have busy schedules and that just speaks to the culture of this place, so selfless.
I know my number is up there, but it wouldn't be if it weren't for all of you.”.
Clark led Iowa to two consecutive national title games.
In her senior season, she led the nation in scoring (31.6 per game) and assists (8.9 per game)..
She also showed some love to her former head coach and everyone who has supported her throughout her career.
“There wasn't many people when I first signed here when I said, 'I wanted to take this place to the Final Four' that they kind of laughed at me and Coach (Lisa Bluder) was literally the only person that agreed with me, thank God, or else we probably wouldn't be here.
I'm just very lucky and fortunate.”.
Clark added: “To all the people that just poured into me over the course of my career, from the people that don't get any recognition, from our media team, to our managers, all of you that have given so much of yourselves to allow me to be who I am, thank you.
I can't say it enough.
I wouldn't be here without all of you.”.
The 23-year-old is the only Division I player, man or woman, to lead her conference (Big Ten) in scoring and assists in four consecutive seasons.
She was selected to the All-Big Ten first team four times in four years, the first to ever do so in program history.
The Indiana Fever picked her with the No. 1 overall selection in the 2024 WNBA draft.
The National Player of the Year capped off a historic career at Iowa by having a groundbreaking year in her first season in the league.
Clark won the 2024 Rookie of the Year award in a near-unanimous vote.
## A'ja Wilson: 'I am overwhelmed with gratitude and joy' .
Wilson got very emotional as her jersey was lifted to the Colonial Life Arena's rafters in Columbia, South Carolina, before No. 2 Gamecocks' 83-66 victory over the Auburn Tigers.
“I am overwhelmed with gratitude and joy to have my jersey retired at the University of South Carolina, the place where my dreams began is an honor I can hardly put into words,” the school's first four-time All-American and National Player of the Year in 2018 told the Gamecock faithful.
“Columbia, South Carolina, is my home and it shaped me not just as an athlete but as a person.
As I would look up in the in the rafters and see my jersey, I'm reminded how important it is to chase your dreams without fear.”.
South Carolina's all-time leading scorer still currently holds 22 school records.
Wilson led the Gamecocks to their first Southeastern Conference (SEC) tournament title, first NCAA Final Four and first NCAA national championship.
She is also the first player in SEC history to win the Player of the Year three times.
The 28-year-old expressed gratitude to the “incredible” fans and South Carolina head coach Dawn Staley for their support.
“You fill this arena with energy and passion, making every game an unforgettable experience.
It's a privilege to be a Gamecock, to be a part of this community and one of the greatest honors of my life was representing Garnet and Black every night.”.
She continued: “Thank you coach for seeing the light in me even when I couldn't see it in myself and for showing me that it's not about the destination but the journey and the people you meet along the way.”.
Wilson was the top overall selection in the 2018 WNBA draft by the Las Vegas Aces as she became the first South Carolina player to accomplish that feat.
Wilson was unanimously selected 2018 WNBA Rookie of the Year.
In 2021, South Carolina honored Wilson with an 11-foot bronze statue outside the main entrance of the arena.
Last season, Wilson was unanimously named the WNBA MVP, her third time winning the award and set the record for the most points in a WNBA season .
The No. 22 jersey will never be worn by any women's college basketball player at Iowa or South Carolina.

Title: Summary of 2025 Grammys: Artists show support for LA and more great moments | CNN
# Summary of 2025 Grammys: Artists show support for LA and more great moments | CNN.
CNN — .
The 2025 Grammys had a tough task.
Music's biggest night took place in Los Angeles, just weeks after wildfires left unprecedented destruction across the city.
Instead of looking away, the award show chose to use the platform and captive audience for good and a lot of singing and dancing along the way.
At the top of the show, host Trevor Noah said that instead of just celebrating music, the ceremony would be “a celebration of the humanity and spirit of survival.”
And that it was.
Here's some of highlights of the ceremony, including, yes, Beyoncé's big win:.
They finally said her name.
Beyoncé won the Grammy for album of the year for her genre-bending “Cowboy Carter,” capturing an elusive first win in the category after four previous nominations over the course of her highly-decorated career.
Presented to her by members of the Los Angeles Fire Department, Beyoncé accepted the award while standing next to her daughter, Blu Ivy.
“I just feel very full and very honored,” she said.
“It's been many, many years.”.
Lady Gaga and Billie Eilish were seen with tears in their eyes watching from the crowd.
The win was Beyoncé's third of the night.
The Grammy Awards' love for the City of Angels began with an opening act that brought Altadena natives Dawes to the stage with Sheryl Crow, Brad Paisley, John Legend, Brittany Howard and St. Vincent for an unforgettable cover of Randy Newman's “I Love L.A.” And it didn't end there.
Commercial time was given to local businesses affected by last month's wildfire, with famous faces making cameos.
Noah directed viewers to a QR code on the screen to raise money for MusiCares Fire Relief and other charities - $7 million was raised during the show, he announced near the end of the broadcast.
LA-native Billie Eilish performed her hit “Birds of a Feather” in a rustic setting reminiscent of the hiking trails throughout LA County, while what appeared to be childhood photos showed in the background.
Later, Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars took the stage to perform a pared down cover of the 1965 song “California Dreamin'” by The Mamas & the Papas, following a pre-taped piece that highlighted harrowing images of damaged homes and heartbroken families.
Gloomy?
At times, but the show's main message was one of hope and an invitation to join those finding ways to usher in better days.
The task of striking the right tone for the night rested upon the capable shoulders of comedian Noah.
The five-time host knew when to have fun and when to let the moment breathe.
Speaking of the relief efforts, Noah said, “You know, it's often said that in the darkest times, the best of humanity shines through.”.
With ease and an authentic charm, Noah, too, shined.
Let's be clear: Speeches are hard.
But this year's Grammy winners came prepared.
Doechii, winner for best rap album, was among those who took the stage with a heartfelt message that acknowledged her position in history as only the third female to win the award. (Lauryn Hill and Cardi B were the others.).
“I put my heart and my soul into this mixtape,” she said.
“I bared my life.
I went through so much.
I dedicated myself to sobriety and God told me that I would be rewarded.”.
She concluded her speech with words of inspiration.
“I know that there is some Black girl out there, so many Black women out there, that were watching me right now and I want to tell you.
Anything is possible,” she said. “
Don't allow anybody to project any stereotypes on you that tell you you can't be here, that you're too dark or that you're not smart enough or that you're too dramatic or you're too loud.
You are exactly who you need to be to be right where you are and I am a testimony.”.
Beyoncé, winner for best country album for “Cowboy Carter,' also brought a message of empowerment, prior to her win for album of the year.
“I think sometimes genre is a cold word to keep us in our place as artists,” she said.
“And I just want to encourage people to do what they're passionate about and stay persistent.”.
Later, best new artist winner Chappell Roan stood up for emerging artists, calling on record companies to provide living wages and health care for rising artists.
She's been in their shoes, she said.
“It was so devastating to feel so committed to my art and feel so betrayed by the system and so dehumanized to not have help,” she said, adding, “Labels, we got you, but do you got us?”.
Honorees didn't steer away from political subjects, with Shakira dedicating her fourth career Grammy to immigrants, Lady Gaga speaking in support of the LGBTQ community and Alicia Keys addressing recent attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion programs.
“DEI is not a threat; it's a gift,” she said.
Best new artist nominee Raye may soon join the ranks of other musicians known by a singular name after her memorable performance.
With strings and horns section behind her, she sang a rendition of her song “Oscar Winning Tears,” closing out a series of performances by those nominated in that category - including Doechii, Benson Boone, Teddy Swims and Khruangbin.
Later, in a tribute to the late producer and musician Quincy Jones, introduced by Will Smith, “Wicked” star Cynthia Erivo performed a sublime version of “Fly Me To the Moon,” the hit standard Jones produced for Frank Sinatra in 1964.
Lainey Wilson, Herbie Hancock, Stevie Wonder and more joined in the tribute.
Wonder praised Jones' generosity and the work he did to produce “We Are the World.”.
Also, shoutout to Shakira, whose hips and abs still don't lie but do defy the laws of nature.

Title: Trump says banning TikTok won't make Americans safer from China.
He may have a point | CNN Business
# Trump says banning TikTok won't make Americans safer from China.
He may have a point | CNN Business.
New York CNN — .
President Donald Trump on Wednesday batted down the national security concerns surrounding TikTok, saying, “Is it that important for China to be spying on young people?
On young kids watching crazy videos?”.
It was a surprising comment coming from the guy who first tried to ban TikTok from the United States over worries that the Chinese government could use the app to gather intelligence on Americans.
In his 2020 executive order that unsuccessfully tried to ban the app, Trump said TikTok's data collection could allow China's government “to track the locations of Federal employees and contractors, build dossiers of personal information for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage.” .
Since Trump's 2020 executive order , US lawmakers have largely agreed that it poses a risk.
State and federal government agencies and the military have restricted staff from downloading the app on their work devices, beginning during Trump's first term.
And last year, Congress passed a law with bipartisan support requiring parent company ByteDance to sell TikTok to a non-Chinese owner or face a ban, which the Supreme Court upheld on national security grounds.
But Trump's comment about data security — while dramatically oversimplified — may have some merit.
Some privacy and technology experts say simply transferring control of TikTok to a new owner won't be a silver bullet to protect US users' data from China, given that Beijing has plenty of other avenues for accessing information about Americans.
Other social media platforms and websites collect similar data to TikTok — such as location data, search history and purchase history — and many other sites sell that data to data brokers, which make it available online for any willing buyer.
“The Chinese government can simply buy US user data from data brokers.
It is widely available,” Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told CNN's “Terms of Service” podcast earlier this month.
“If US lawmakers really cared about protecting American users' data from the Chinese government, they would pass comprehensive data privacy legislation that would limit what kind of data all companies can collect and what kind of data all companies can sell,” she said. (TikTok CEO Shou Chew testified before Congress in 2023 that the company does not sell to data brokers.) .
China also has advanced cyber-espionage capabilities that in just the past year have allowed the country to spy on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, the government office that reviews foreign investments for national security risk, as well as American telecom networks .
Data collection isn't the only concern surrounding TikTok.
US lawmakers worry that the Chinese government could force ByteDance to manipulate the TikTok algorithm , to spread Chinese propaganda or disinformation, or to sow discord among Americans. .
But even then, Chinese government actors have also successfully weaponized US-owned social media platforms to spread disinformation and harass Americans. (TikTok has also denied that Beijing would have access to manipulate its algorithm.) .
Still, contrary to Trump's point, TikTok is far more than just “young kids watching crazy videos.”
Around half of the US population — 170 million Americans — use the platform, often to discuss news, politics and world events.
Trump's comment may be aimed at garnering support for his proposal that, rather than a wholesale transfer of US TikTok to an American buyer, the United States and China could share control of the platform as a 50-50 joint venture.
It's unclear if that suggestion would satisfy the letter of the TikTok sale-or-ban law, which seeks to prevent a foreign adversary from controlling such a popular social media platform.
The reversal in Trump's stance on TikTok has raised questions about why he is apparently less concerned now about TikTok threatening US national security.
Trump has said he changed his mind because he “got to use it.” .
One explanation “could be that China is less powerful than it was five years ago.
Their economy isn't as strong as it used to be; internationally, they're less vocal and active and influential,” said Sarah Kreps, director of the Tech Policy Institute at Cornell University.
But, Kreps said, that alone “doesn't seem enough to me to explain why there was such a national security concern a few years ago and now this is kind of being waved off as not a concern,” especially given China's ongoing interest in and success in spying on Americans through other means, she said.
Still, whether TikTok's US operations are sold in part or entirely, it could be difficult — if not impossible — to ensure that Beijing no longer has any means of controlling it, given that the technology originated in China.
“Whether you have 25%, 50%, 99% American-owned, it's a legitimate question of whether from an engineering perspective, you can disentangle this Chinese control within the source code from TikTok itself,” Kreps said.
TikTok, for its part, has tried for years to assuage US concerns by storing American users' data in Oracle-owned servers in the United States, offering access for third-party monitors to review its systems and saying it could not be accessed by its China-based parent company even if Beijing officials demanded it — albeit unsuccessfully.
Although it may not be a perfect solution, some experts say the sale of TikTok — in its entirety — is still crucial for US national security because of the potential that China could use TikTok's trove of user data and manipulate the app's algorithm to target Americans with specific videos they might be inclined to believe or engage with.
Justice Brett Kavanaugh summarized that concern from Congress in the Supreme Court hearing earlier this month over TikTok's challenge to the sale-or-ban law, which the court shot down.
American lawmakers, Kavanaugh said, “were concerned that China was accessing information about millions of Americans, tens of millions of Americans, including teenagers, people in their twenties” and that the country could use that information “to turn people, to blackmail people — people who a generation from now will be working in the FBI or the CIA or in the State Department.”.
“I think that's where it gets really, truly dangerous from a national security perspective,” said Lindsay Gorman, managing director of the German Marshall Fund's technology program.
In theory, ByteDance, at the behest of China, could use “this incredibly powerful tool to influence Americans at the… individual level toward certain views and certain actions.”.

Title: I don't have diabetes, but I wore a glucose monitor for six weeks.
Here's what I learned about food (and anxiety) | CNN
# I don't have diabetes, but I wore a glucose monitor for six weeks.
Here's what I learned about food (and anxiety) | CNN.
CNN — .
One day in September, I stood in front of my open refrigerator, ravenous but unable to figure out what I should eat.
I was worried that whatever I chose to eat would cause the new app on my phone to record a spike in my glucose levels that would count against the number I was allowed that day - and I was determined to conquer this algorithm.
I'd just put on a continuous glucose monitor, a device that sticks to your arm and uses a tiny needle to provide near-real-time information about how much sugar is circulating in your blood - not because I have diabetes, the main use for what are called CGMs, but because these devices are starting to be marketed as wellness tools for everybody, and I wanted to see how they work.
Apple?
Too sugary.
Granola bar?
Hello, glucose spike.
Cheese - that's the ticket.
A few days of wearing this monitor had taught me that cheese would not cause my glucose to go up.
“Is this thing just inadvertently putting you on the keto diet ?” my husband - who'd witnessed a few episodes of hanger while I was trying to figure out how to please my CGM - finally asked.
Pretty much.
Avoiding carbohydrates and prioritizing protein and fat, often together, didn't lead to spikes in glucose that my CGM and app, Lingo from the health company Abbott, would count against me.
But because I wasn't aiming to switch to a very low-carb, ketogenic diet, I initially struggled to figure out what to eat; in the first week or so of wearing the CGM, my scale read my weight at 3 pounds lower than usual - a blip, I presume, because I was too nervous to eat normally.
This is not, unsurprisingly, how experts say CGMs should be used, whether you have diabetes or not.
Continuous glucose monitors have been revolutionary for people with type 1 diabetes, for whom glucose levels are life and death, providing information about how much insulin they need to inject to keep their blood sugar stable.
The alternative is finger-stick testing , pricking fingertips to draw drops of blood to check glucose levels, often multiple times a day.
“CGMs are life-changing for insulin-dependent diabetics,” said Laura Marston , an attorney and advocate for lower insulin prices who was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes as a teenager.
Before she got a CGM, she said, she'd go long periods without checking her glucose levels through finger-stick tests, instead adjusting her insulin doses based on how she was feeling, leading to hospitalizations with a dangerous condition known as diabetic ketoacidosis .
Now, Marston said, she knows her glucose level every five minutes with a CGM, and her A1C, another measure of glucose in the blood, is steadily at a much better level - something she attributes both to the CGM and to focusing more on dealing with diabetes and having steadier health insurance.
In that context, CGMs are medical devices, requiring prescriptions and - usually , but not always - receiving coverage through health insurance.
CGMs can be covered for people with type 2 diabetes who use insulin, as well.
But this year, Dexcom and Abbott , the two major makers of CGMs, introduced biosensors for people who don't use insulin, available without a prescription and for about $89 a month out of pocket.
Dexcom's offering, called Stelo, was cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration in March, based on data from a clinical study showing that the device performed similarly to other CGMs.
In an FDA release, Dr. Jeff Shuren, then director of the agency's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said that “CGMs can be a powerful tool to help monitor blood glucose” and that “giving more individuals valuable information about their health, regardless of their access to a doctor or health insurance, is an important step forward in advancing health equity for US patients.”.
Abbott's Lingo was cleared in June and is targeted specifically for “consumers who want to better understand and improve their health and wellness,” the company said in a news release.
The idea is that seeing near-instantaneous feedback to the glucose effects of food, exercise, sleep and stress might give people insights about unique ways their bodies react to different inputs and help them make changes to improve their health.
I was excited to try it.
Putting the device on was surprisingly painless, and an hour after the little disc was secured to my arm, I started seeing my glucose levels on the accompanying app on my phone.
“117,” I messaged Dr. Jody Dushay , a physician at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center who works with people with obesity and diabetes and who'd offered to review my CGM findings with me.
The Lingo app told me that was within what it called a “typical healthy glucose range” of 70 to 140 milligrams per deciliter, noting that “occasionally, you may find yourself over 140 mg/dL or under 70 mg/dL, which is expected.”.
Dushay had warned me before I put on the CGM that blood sugar could range from the high 50s when fasting to the 150s after eating in a generally healthy young woman.
She also emphasized that continuous glucose monitoring shouldn't be used to diagnose prediabetes or diabetes.
Her caution about how I might react to seeing my data turned out to be warranted.
In the first week I wore the monitor, I was glued to the app, watching my glucose rise shortly after eating.
The app accumulates metrics that it calls Lingo Counts to try to help users make sense of the data, with a higher number associated with a bigger or longer elevation of glucose.
Although the app gave me an initial target of 60 or under for my daily Lingo Count, I found myself trying to keep it as low as possible, a tendency reinforced by the app's suggestions to do 20 squats after lunch to “find some balance” as my count was going up.
I ended up keeping my count so low initially that the app reset my daily target to 22, which I exceeded frequently once some of my anxiety wore off.
And although the finding that cheese didn't lead to a glucose spike wasn't a huge surprise, there were a few other readings that were interesting.
A salad with chopped vegetables and quinoa that I thought was a healthy choice for a quick lunch registered one of my largest Lingo Counts of the week, probably because of the sugar in the peanut dressing.
A glass of wine and a slice of pizza, on the other hand, didn't cause a glucose surge - a happy revelation but not one that I can pretend will lead to better health.
“Your values are all completely normal,” Dushay told me when I sent her screengrabs of my glucose levels.
“What look like 'spikes' are perfectly fine excursions within the normal range.”.
But could those increases, even within a normal range, give me feedback on ways I could feel healthier?
Stay full longer?
Have more energy?
Lower my risk of metabolic disease?
Or would I learn only that, as Marston put it, my “pancreas functions as it should”?.
It depends on whom you ask; the scientific community appears to be divided on the value of continuous glucose monitoring for people who don't have diabetes, a gulf that researchers say is exacerbated by a lack of data.
There are “definitely a lot of strong opinions in the field,” said Dr. Nicole Spartano , an assistant professor at Boston University's Chobanian and Avedisian School of Medicine who studies CGM use in non-diabetic people.
Spartano said she conducted a study in which she surveyed clinicians who had expertise on CGMs and asked them to interpret about 20 reports on glucose levels in people without diabetes.
“There's no consensus about how they view the data,” she said.
“Some people think high spikes are bad; some people think they're meaningless in people without diabetes; some people think, 'if it's a prolonged period of a glucose excursion,'” over 180 or so, those people should be screened for diabetes;
“other experts will see that and say that person is fine.”.
Dr. Robert Lustig , professor emeritus of pediatrics in the Division of Endocrinology at the University of California San Francisco, who's written several books warning against excess sugar and processed foods, is in the camp that says keeping glucose down is crucial.
He argues that continuous glucose monitoring is useful for people without diabetes - if users get the right help interpreting their data.
“Not everybody responds to the same foods as everyone else,” said Lustig, who's an adviser to a company called Levels that offers continuous glucose monitoring along with an app.
“The goal is to keep your glucose down, because when you keep your glucose down, you keep your insulin down, and when you keep your insulin down, then the insulin is not there to drive energy into fat, and it's not there to cause cell growth, which is at the heart of chronic metabolic disease.” .
Lustig acknowledged that people using CGMs could experience the same anxiety I initially felt about the glucose data - but argued that anxiety could be lessened if users receive more help interpreting the information.
And Dushay and Spartano emphasized that it would be particularly important for people who have a history of disordered eating or other food anxiety to talk with health-care providers before using a CGM.
But for some, the devices provide surprising insights about how different people react to foods - like CNN's chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta , who's worn a CGM along with his wife, Rebecca.
Neither has diabetes, but they were curious about what they could learn to potentially improve their health.
“When I eat blueberries, my glucose will not spike at all,” he said.
“When she eats blueberries, her glucose will immediately spike.”.
With rice, he said, it's the opposite: His glucose spikes, while Rebecca's doesn't.
An Indian flatbread he's been eating since he was a kid also caused a major increase.
And sometimes, Gupta said, his glucose can go up to 180 milligrams per deciliter.
With a history of diabetes in his family, which he's discussed on his “ Chasing Life ” podcast, that's enough to make him want to avoid those foods.
After four weeks of wearing a CGM - each biosensor device lasts two weeks - I decided to take a break and formulate a better plan before I applied my third and final monitor.
I realized that the way I'd approached it the first time around was, as Dushay put it, “an artificial experiment”: I wasn't using the CGM to get feedback about how I normally eat; I was eating abnormally in immediate response to the CGM.
“Your first biosensor [should be] a look at what you've been doing over time, kind of what your body's been experiencing, even though you didn't have that peek behind the curtain,” said Pam Nisevich Bede , nutritionist for Abbott's Lingo business.
“And then you're starting to experiment with a few different food choices, timing of meals, et cetera.
And then with your next biosensor, you're going to be fine-tuning those habits.” .
I decided not to look at my glucose levels for the first week of wearing the final monitor, recording my food by hand and entering it into the app at the end of each day.
And in the second week, I'd try to make changes.
I also repeated some meals to measure whether my glucose response was consistent, as a National Institutes of Health study found significant variability in CGM readings even in the same person to the same food, according to its author, Dr. Kevin Hall , a senior investigator with the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.
I'd just baked banana bread with my kids, so I repeated that for breakfast a few times that week and generated a fairly consistent increase in glucose, registering a 10 on my Lingo Count one day and an 11 another.
On a third day, exercising afterwards blunted my Lingo Count by a few points.
Even so, my glucose never exceeded about 136 milligrams per deciliter, even at its highest after banana bread.
Swapping in Greek yogurt or chia pudding appeared to avoid accumulating Lingo Counts, although I'm not sure I needed a CGM to tell me those might be better choices than banana bread for breakfast.
One thing the CGM did do was nudge me to avoid snacking mindlessly, which may be the kind of small behavioral modification that can make a difference.
I didn't want to have to track every bite of graham cracker I indulged in during my kids' afternoon snack or to see the resulting increases in glucose on my app.
“I think there's a place for it in terms of behavioral management,” said Spartano, who's leading research into whether CGMs can predict the development of diabetes as part of the Framingham Heart Study .
“We're just really early in this research space.” .

Title: What this teenager wants you to know about the damaging effects of AI | CNN
# What this teenager wants you to know about the damaging effects of AI | CNN.
Editor's note: Mary Frances Ruskell is a senior at Heathwood Hall Episcopal School in Columbia, South Carolina.
CNN — .
My friend Sammy turned around at his desk and grinned at me.
He held out his phone and waved it in front of my face, the universal sign for “Look at this!”
It was a video of a capybara in a swimming pool, seemingly treading water like a human does, feet down and arms circling.
Last year, I would have believed the post I saw on that screen and accepted it as part of what I know to be true about the world: capybaras tread water like people.
Now, I wasn't sure.
Even though teens spend so much of our lives online, a new study by Common Sense Media found that teens between the ages of 13 and 18 increasingly do not trust the content they consume online.
With the emergence of generative AI — a type of artificial intelligence that produces content such as images, text and videos — it has become easy to quickly produce fake visual content.
My friends and I have noticed these AI-generated images flooding social media platforms.
### What's real and what's not? .
Many teens struggle to figure out what online content is real and what is fake, according to the study.
Some 46% said they either know that they have been misled by content or suspect that they have been, while 54% have seen visual content that “was real, but misleading.”.
Collected by Ipsos Public Affairs on behalf of Common Sense Media from March to May 2024, the survey data is from a nationally representative survey that includes responses from 1,045 American adults (age 18 or older) who are parents or guardians of one or more teens age 13 to 18, and responses from one of the teenage children in each of those parents' families.
Maybe the teens who reported that they haven't been misled are just absolute aces at spotting fake images, but I wonder if they just haven't realized that they have, in fact, been swindled by AI images.
“Many kids don't see flaws that they aren't trained to detect,” said Robbie Torney, Common Sense Media's senior director of AI programs, in an email.
“Knowing that the media we consume can be retouched, modified, or even fake, it's crucial that we all learn to think critically about information we encounter.”.
I think that I'm generally pretty good at spotting AI images, but there was once a time when I believed that I couldn't be fooled.
That was mostly in the early days of generative AI, when people in AI-generated photos typically had 15 fingers.
But I no longer think I can't be fooled.
More than 70% of the surveyed teens who have experienced deceptive visual content reported it has changed how they view the accuracy of content.
I'm part of that group now.
After a few too many cool posts of alleged historical pictures that turned out to be fake, I generally distrust most pictures I see if they are not posted by someone I know.
I examine the fingers of any human picture first, since I know AI can still get the number of human fingers wrong.
I have begun checking the comments of nearly every post I come across to see whether other users believe it.
Doubt in the back of my mind now colors my response to everything I look at, and what I think.
Since third grade, I have been warned about checking sources and not believing everything you read.
I have been generally distrustful of information from the internet for years, so AI has not suddenly damaged my trust in online information.
What has changed is my trust in images.
Seeing is not believing anymore.
I used to accept photos as fact.
Before AI, there were programs people used to photoshop images, but those images are still real images of real people, just tweaked.
Colors could be changed, and things could be cut out — but the original photo was an image of real life.
As generative AI improves, however, completely fake content is getting harder for me to spot.
One of the primary ways that my friends and I communicate is with images and videos.
Memes are their own form of communication.
Sharing an Instagram post about some weird scientific fact or interesting historical photo shows you know what a friend would find interesting.
Sending someone funny video clips is a form of affection.
It tells someone you remember them and lets you share an inside joke.
While I'm no longer a heavy social media user, I still probably see hundreds of images a day online.
Other teens who spend more time on Instagram than I do or who use TikTok might see thousands.
If those “photos” are just images cobbled together by a machine, wholly detached from anything real, what can I believe?
I already doubt everything I read online.
This mistrust is spreading into teens' offline lives.
Studies show that teens already have low trust in institutions such as the government and news media.
Doubt in the world around us is rampant among my friends.
It's common for me to hear dismissive statements thrown around, even about the textbooks we read in class.
I've heard refrains like “Eh, maybe they did that,”
“Might be true,” and “I don't believe that” thrown out about anything and everything.
My classmates and I often doubt the news, history and authority figures.
If teens can no longer trust what they read, hear or see online, why should they trust anything?.
In a generation in which mistrust could very well become the default approach to life, what can a person rely on?
Or hope for?
What's the point of caring about anything, if it could all be false?
One of my teachers thinks that members of Generation Z (born between 1997 and 2012) are nihilists , whether they know it or not.
My friends and I struggle with these questions, and I think my teacher may be right.
How does this get fixed?
The Common Sense study found that 74% of teens agree that generative AI “should have visible warnings that its outputs could be harmful, biased, or wrong.”
And 73% of teens want content generated by AI “to be labeled or watermarked” to show its source.
I believe this demand is because we're losing ground in what we can believe.
I wish that I could trust what I see, and AI-generated content being required to be marked as fake is a reassuring idea.
“The growing mistrust in AI mirrors historical challenges with media literacy,” Torney said via email.
“Just as we learned to evaluate traditional media by asking 'who created this?' and why was it made?', we must now apply these same critical thinking skills to AI-generated content.”.
It's a good solution, no doubt.
But it still means that we cannot initially trust what we see.
Instead, we must examine it, question it, and have faith in ourselves that we've come to the right conclusion.
People say that social media and increased time online is making us lonely because of the absence of physical connection.
And maybe that's part of the deep loneliness, and the increasing anxiety and depression we know teenagers today report.
But if this loss of trust continues, I think we'll become even more individualistic and form shallower connections with each other.
If mistrust becomes the default approach to life, what would be the point of doing anything for other people that you don't already know?
Will we be able to get to know each other deeply, or successfully communicate?.
Can you really build a life when you don't know what is real and what is fake, when you can never trust what you see, what you learn, or how the world works?.
Artificial intelligence is just that: artificial.
When some of the main tools you use as a teenager to connect with real friends — memes and social media — are corrupted with artificiality, how do you make real connections?
When the main way teenagers learn about the bigger world outside of their schools and towns is the internet, can we ever understand the world?.

Title: Santorini in Greece hit by 200 earthquakes, sparking school closures | CNN
# Santorini in Greece hit by 200 earthquakes, sparking school closures | CNN.
Athens CNN — .
Schools will be closed Monday on the iconic Greek island of Santorini after a series of 200 earthquakes shook the popular tourist destination in recent days.
Authorities have also advised residents to avoid large indoor gatherings and steer clear of multiple ports, including the old port of Fira, just below the island's capital.
Schools will also be shut in the nearby Aegean islands of Anafi, Ios and Amorgos, authorities said Sunday.
Between Friday and Sunday, more than 200 earthquakes were detected between Santorini and Amorgos, including a 4.6-magnitude quake, the most powerful so far, according to authorities.
Santorini is no stranger to earthquakes , sitting as it does on several fault lines.
The risk of tremors doesn't stop a reported 3.4 million people from visiting the island each year - far outnumbering Santorini's 20,000 or so residents.
The holiday destination, famed for its crescent-shaped caldera, which was created by one of the largest known volcanic eruptions around 3,600 years ago, has been dubbed Greece's “Instagram island” due to its photogenic golden light and sweeping scenery.
An emergency committee met Sunday to assess the risks posed by the latest tremors, while another meeting is scheduled for Monday.
Santorini is part of the Hellenic Volcanic Arc, one of the most active volcanic fields in Europe, which has seen more than 100 eruptions over the past 400,000 years.
Authorities said current seismic activity is due to tectonic movements that do not appear related to volcanic activity.
Similarly, increased seismic activity in 2011 and 2012 did not result in any eruptions, they noted.
The most recent large quake in Santorini struck on July 9, 1956.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake was followed by a 25-meter-high (around 80 feet) tsunami.
At least 53 people were killed and more than 100 injured, while at least one-third of the houses collapsed.

Title: Big changes at Starbucks roll out Monday | CNN Business
# Big changes at Starbucks roll out Monday | CNN Business.
New York CNN — .
Changes at Starbucks might remind customers of the chain of the old.
Beginning Monday, several policies are returning to Starbucks' locations in United States and Canada — part of CEO Brian Niccol's Herculean task of reversing sales and traffic declines at the struggling institution.
The chain is bringing back condiment bars after they were taken away during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic , and baristas will return to hand-writing customers' names on their cups using Sharpies.
Both changes are part of Starbucks' plans to reboot the coffee house vibe that's diminished in recent years.
The return of milk and sugar stations are a small step for Starbucks, but it represents something much bigger for the world's largest coffee chain.
It's an acknowledgment that Starbucks went too far in overloading its baristas with endless ways to prepare drinks.
Niccol said in a previous earnings call that “our customers are asking for it and our baristas are saying it would help them deliver the speed of service that they want to provide.”.
The return of personalizing cups is also a Niccol directive, who previously said the chain has to “track down” 200,000 Sharpies to make it happen.
Starbucks released a new TV advertisement promoting the personal touches that comes with handwritten notes, as well as a slight name update to “Starbucks Coffee Company.” (The company didn't immediately respond to CNN's request for comment about the branding change.) .
Also, free refills on some “for here” orders are expanding to all of its paying customers — a perk that was once reserved for members of its loyalty program.
They will be served in ceramic mugs or a clean personal cup brought from home and are eligible for hot or iced coffee and tea orders.
In addition, Starbucks isn't letting anyone hang out or use its restrooms without making a purchase.
The company said in a press release Monday it heard from customers and employees that “access to comfortable seating and a clean, safe environment is critical to getting back to the Starbucks they know and love” resulting in the company scrapping its open-door policy.
Other tweaks include a ban on panhandling, discrimination, consuming outside alcohol and vaping, according to the policy posted online .
Employees have received training on the new rules.
Starbucks ( SBUX ) stock is up 7% over the past 12 months, but the company has posted three straight quarters of slumping sales and declining customer visits.
Global sales at stores open at least a year fell 7% last quarter and the number of customer transactions sinking by 8%. .
Investors will see how Niccol's turnaround plan is doing after the bell on Tuesday, when the company releases its next earnings report.

# Stock futures slide after Trump imposes tariffs | CNN Business.
CNN — .
US stock market futures plunged Sunday, one day after President Donald Trump announced 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico and 10% tariffs on China set to go into effect on Tuesday.
Dow futures were down 1.4%, or over 600 points, while S&P 500 futures dropped 1.9%.
The futures traded for tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite were down 2.4% as of 6:36 p.m. ET.
Bitcoin was also down 3.5% over the last 24 hours.
The sharp selloff in the futures market implies the indexes will also open substantially lower when trading kicks off Monday at 9:30 a.m. ET.
Hours after the Trump administration announced the tariffs, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said her country will impose retaliatory tariffs, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced “far-reaching” retaliatory levies.
China's commerce ministry said it will file a complaint with the World Trade Organization and “take corresponding countermeasures,” without elaborating.
“This will include immediate tariffs on $30 billion worth of goods as of Tuesday, followed by further tariffs on $125 billion of American products in 21 days' time, to allow Canadian companies and supply chains to seek to find alternatives,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Saturday.
More than 1,200 goods will be impacted by Canada's immediate tariffs, according to senior government officials on Sunday.
The imposed tariffs would be harmful for states such as Florida, which exports orange juice, fruits and vegetables to Canada, officials said.
Both the Mexican peso and the Canadian dollar weakened relative to the US dollar in the 24 hours since Trump announced the new tariffs, while the Chinese yuan hit a new low.
Economists warned that American families may bear the burden of these tariffs — and Trump posted to his Truth Social account that Americans could face “some pain.”
The tariffs will make groceries more expensive because Mexico and Canada are the main sources of America's imported agricultural goods .
Gas, steel and cars are among other goods expected to be more expensive for American consumers.

Title: With no evidence, Trump blamed DEI for a plane crash | CNN Business
# With no evidence, Trump blamed DEI for a plane crash | CNN Business.
New York CNN — .
President Donald Trump on Thursday blamed the Federal Aviation Administration's “diversity push” in part for the plane collision that killed 67 people in Washington, DC.
But DEI backers, including most top US companies, believe a push for diversity has been good for their businesses.
Trump did not cite any evidence for how efforts to hire more minorities, people with disabilities and other groups less represented in American workforces led to the crash, saying “it just could have been” and that he had “common sense.”
But Trump criticized the FAA's effort to recruit people with disabilities during Joe Biden's administration, even though the FAA's Aviation Safety Workforce Plan for the 2020-2029 period, issued under Trump's first administration, promoted and supported “the hiring of people with disabilities and targeted disabilities.” .
It's not the first time opponents of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, or DEI, have said they can kill people.
“DEI means people DIE,” Elon Musk said after the California wildfires , criticizing the Los Angeles Fire Department and city and state officials for their efforts to advance diversity in their workforces.
The Trump administration has clamped down on DEI in the federal government, ordering government DEI employees to be placed on leave, ending the use of DEI in hiring and federal contracting, and other measures to end DEI practices.
In the business world, DEI is typically a mix of recruiting practices, employee training and other measures to boost representation of people of different races, genders, classes, religions and other backgrounds.
Rather than lower hiring standards, supporters say DEI broadens the pool of people employers would consider for a job, in theory finding even more qualified people for tasks than they would have found in the past.
Companies that abandon efforts to promote diversity and inclusion risk missing out on the best talent, business leaders say.
“At its best, DEI is about developing talent, measuring it in a fair way and finding hidden talent and disadvantaged talent in a world where not everybody has an equal chance to exhibit their abilities,” Ken Frazier, the first Black chief executive of a major pharmaceutical company, told CNN in an October interview .
DEI initiatives have been shown to boost profits, reduce employee attrition and increase employee motivation, according to Boston Consulting Group research based on data from more than 27,000 employees in 16 countries.
Amid growing opposition from right-wing activists, lawsuits from conservative legal groups, demand from conservative-leaning customers and other factors, many high-profile companies have stepped back from some of their DEI pledges.
Walmart, McDonald's, Target, Harley-Davidson, Ford and many others have made changes to their DEI initiatives.
However, most companies remain committed to DEI.
The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that opposes DEI, found in November that 486 of the Fortune 500 companies still have a statement or corporate commitment to DEI on their websites.
Most of the changes companies like Walmart and Target have made are “cosmetic” and “inconsequential,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, the president of the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute.
Companies are adjusting language or repositioning programs rather than abandoning their commitments to expand diversity.
“Most of the leaders I speak to absolutely see the value [of diversity],” said Tarang Amin, the CEO of e.l.f.
Beauty, a cosmetics company that has stood behind its DEI programs.
“There's just so much data that says diverse teams perform better than homogeneous teams, that diverse thought really drives better outcomes.” .
Bigger companies are standing firmly behind DEI, too.
Costco recently rejected a proposal brought by a conservative think tank, the National Center for Public Policy Research, that would have required Costco to report on the financial risks of maintaining its diversity and inclusion goals.
The group criticized Costco for possible “illegal discrimination” against employees who are “white, Asian, male or straight.” .
Costco said its DEI efforts help the company attract and retain a wide range of employees and improve merchandise and services in stores.
Costco also said its members want to interact with a diverse employee base.
“Among other things, a diverse group of employees helps bring originality and creativity to our merchandise offerings, promoting the 'treasure hunt' that our customers value,” Costco said in its proxy statement to investors.
Efforts at diversity, equity and inclusion “enhance our capacity to attract and retain employees who will help our business succeed.” .

Title: How the Trump administration is building out its immigration enforcement machine | CNN Politics
# How the Trump administration is building out its immigration enforcement machine | CNN Politics.
Washington CNN — .
President Donald Trump has quickly mobilized wide swaths of the federal government to arrest and detain undocumented immigrants in the United States, part of a broader strategy to amass a large enforcement machine.
The administration has sent troops to the US-Mexico border, utilized military aircraft to repatriate recent border crossers, and deployed people from multiple federal agencies, including those under the Justice Department, to augment immigration enforcement operations.
Those shifts may cause tensions between agencies, as they compete for limited resources and manpower.
The administration is also drawing up plans to expand the government's holding capacity, turning to military bases and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
And private contractors are discussing options amongst themselves as they look to ramp up detention capacity.
“This gets them over one of the biggest hurdles they have which is resources,” said John Sandweg, former acting ICE director under the Obama administration, noting that getting additional funds from Congress will take time.
“By elevating this to a national security priority, tapping into DOD's abundant resources and DOJ with the federal agents, it's an immediate surge of resources,” he added.
The Trump administration is also expected to tap state and local law enforcement in the weeks to come to assist in their efforts to arrest undocumented immigrants.
Combined, the efforts mark a dramatic scaling up of the administration's enforcement apparatus and reflect Trump's aggressive immigration agenda.
White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller told CNN's Jake Tapper Tuesday that arrest quotas for Immigration and Customs Enforcement field offices of 75 per day should be treated as a “floor, not a ceiling.”.
“The goal is to arrest at least that many, but hopefully many more, and the Department of Justice is going to be closely involved in providing the manpower to help achieve those objectives,” Miller said.
'A force multiplier' .
US Customs and Border Protection has also been called upon to assist ICE, as the latter agency's field offices come under increasing pressure, according to multiple sources.
Interior enforcement is complex, often requiring careful planning, surveillance and operations that take place in the predawn hours.
Over the course of the past week, teams of ICE officers, along with agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, deployed nationwide to arrest undocumented immigrants who had been targeted as public safety and national security threats, according to Trump officials.
In an interview with CNN last week, White House border czar Tom Homan touted the joint effort, calling it a “gamechanger,” and describing the teams as a “force multiplier.”.
ICE has historically been underfunded and has a limited number of agents.
Trump officials were keenly aware of that as they prepared in the weeks leading up to Inauguration Day, drafting a spate of memos to delegate powers and trigger authorities, according to two sources familiar.
One of those included a Homeland Security memo requesting the help of state and local governments to enforce federal immigration law, citing a “mass influx” of migrants at the US-Mexico border.
That language was deliberate, according to one of the sources, describing the finding as a tool to trigger new state authorities for immigration enforcement.
The memo allows state and local law enforcement officers to carry out immigration enforcement, by invoking a sweeping legal authority that lets the Homeland Security secretary request aid under certain circumstances.
It's unclear how it would be implemented and whether it will require agreements and training.
Some former Homeland Security officials have raised concerns over pivoting law enforcement to immigration-focused missions and potentially leaving other work unattended.
“They clearly can do it.
But there's an opportunity cost.
What aren't they going to do?
” one former Homeland Security official said.
Enlisting the military.
One of the president's first acts, declaring a national emergency at the border, has already yielded action that was prominently showcased by the White House: the use of Pentagon assets on the US southern border.
The administration expanded its military flights carrying migrants to Ecuador last week, after a public feud with Colombia that almost resulted in a trade war.
And at the request of the Department of Homeland Security, Buckley Space Force Base in Colorado will be used to stage and process immigrants.
The facility is manned by ICE, among other agencies.
“This is only just the beginning,” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said in a post on X Monday.
Trump on Wednesday signed a memorandum directing the federal government to prepare the US Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to house migrants.
The process of expanding the holding facility is expected to last weeks and likely to fall short of Trump's stated goal of 30,000 people, given space constraints.
Guantanamo Bay hosts a separate migrant processing center previously used to temporarily house migrants apprehended at sea.
Under the Biden administration, Homeland Security officials considered using the center to temporarily hold more migrants in the event of mass maritime migration.
The process to expand capacity was expected to take around 30 days, depending on what assistance could be pulled in and how quickly, according to a former Homeland Security official.
Trump's top immigration advisers previously told CNN that management of a Guantanamo Bay detention facility for migrants would be overseen by ICE and reserved for what Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem described as “the worst of the worst.”.
Homan told CNN Wednesday that he wants the Defense Department to be “very involved” in immigration enforcement.
Pressed on how much more money he thinks Congress would need to allocate to fully carry out Trump's immigration plans, Homan said that they are “working on that number now.”.
“We need - the more money we have, the more successful we're going to be, right?
More money for beds, more money for operations,” he said.

Title: Clock ticking toward possible Costco strike Saturday | CNN Business
# Clock ticking toward possible Costco strike Saturday | CNN Business.
New York CNN — .
About 18,000 Teamsters are set to strike 56 Costco stores across six states early Saturday unless an 11th-hour agreement prevents what would be the largest retail strike in US history.
Talks resumed between the two sides Thursday, but there have been no updates on the negotiations.
In addition to disagreements on wages and benefits, the union said Costco had rejected proposals dealing with seniority pay, paid family leave, bereavement policies, sick time , and safeguards against surveillance.
Teamsters members at Costco make up 8% of the 219,000 employees at 616 US stores, according to company filings.
But a strike by that many workers would be significant for the largely nonunion sector.
Labor Department statistics show that less than 5% of retail workers are represented by unions.
Most of those unionized retail workers are in the grocery store sector.
The unionized store locations, which have not been identified by either the union or company, are in California, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Virginia and Washington.
Costco said on Friday that even if there is a strike and unionized workers don't report to work, “all of our locations will be open for business this weekend,” an indication that it intends to use management and nonunion staff to keep stores operating.
Meanwhile, while the Teamsters only represent workers at a small fraction of Costco stores overall, the union is prepared to set up picket lines at an undisclosed number of nonunion Costco stores nationwide, even if workers at those stores remain on the job.
Such a move could greatly increase the economic pressure on the company.
While there are only 18,000 Teamsters at Costco, the union has more than 1 million US members it can call on for those other picket lines.
Costco has a reputation for providing relatively good pay and benefits, especially compared to other retail chains.
Its annual company filing states that “our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits.
Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover, increasing productivity and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average.”.
In late 2023, when workers at a Costco store in Roanoke, Virginia, voted to join the Teamsters, the then-outgoing and incoming CEOs of Costco, Craig Jelinek and Ron Vachris, released a letter to employees.
“We're disappointed in the results in Norfolk,” the letter read.
“We're not disappointed in our employees; we're disappointed in ourselves as managers and leaders.
The fact that a majority of Norfolk employees felt that they wanted or needed a union constitutes a failure on our part.”.
“It was a pretty unique letter.
I've never seen management take that position,” Jane Jacobs, an attorney at Tarter Krinsky & Drogin, who typically represents employers in labor relations, told CNN.
The Teamsters have pointed to Costco's strong financial results as an argument for an improved wage and benefits package.
Costco reported record annual net income in the most recent fiscal year of $7.4 billion — up 17% from a year earlier and nearly double what it earned in 2019 ahead of the Covid-19 pandemic.
At a recent union rally held outside Costco's annual meeting, union members held banners reading: “Pro worker?
Prove it!
” and “Record profits = record contract.”.
“Costco has two choices: respect the workers who made them a success or face a national strike,” Teamsters President Sean O'Brien said in a statement earlier this month.
“If Costco thinks they can exploit our members while raking in billions, we'll shut them down.”.
Jacobs said that despite the differences at the bargaining table, there doesn't appear to be a large difference in total cost between their bargaining positions.
Costco confirmed a Reuters report that it recently sent a letter out to all employees at nonunion stores announcing it was raising pay by a dollar an hour to $30.20 this year and another dollar an hour each of the next two years.
Starting pay would be raised by 50 cents an hour to $20..
Jacobs said a good strategy for any employer is to give the nonunion employees the same pay and benefit package as unionized employees to remove the incentive to join the union.
But she said it's possible the Teamsters go on strike to press their current political advantage.
O'Brien has gotten closer to President Donald Trump than many labor leaders, Jacobs said.
He spoke at the Republican National Convention and did not endorse Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.
Meanwhile, Costco has refused to back off of its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts, which have become a focus of Trump's attacks in the early days of the new term.
Jacobs said she could see Trump publicly taking the side of the Teamsters if it goes on strike at Costco to put pressure on the company.
“This union is set up as well as any union to go on strike,” she said.
“One thing we know about this administration is they'll reward their friends and punish their enemies.”.
Michael Baker, retail analyst at DA Davidson, said that while a strike at only 8% of Costco stores probably isn't enough to prove a significant financial hit to the company's bottom line, a deal that is seen as a win for the union could spur organizing efforts at other stores across the chain.
Katherine Black, a partner in the food, drug and mass market retail segment at management consulting firm Kearney, told CNN that a strike would likely not last more than a week.
“It's very rare in this sector for a strike to lasts more than a few days,” she said.
“The longest I know of was one at Stop & Shop in 2019 that lasted 11 days.”.
Last year, the Teamsters staged a five-day strike at Amazon that ended the day after Christmas.
But unlike the situation at Costco, Amazon does not recognize the union as representing any of its workers and has refused to negotiate, let alone agree to terms on a contract.
Amazon doesn't even recognize that many of the strikers, who are drivers for third-party delivery services and have exclusive contracts with the online retailer, are its employees.

Title: What to do when the Fed starts cutting interest rates | CNN Business
# What to do when the Fed starts cutting interest rates | CNN Business.
New York CNN — .
Over the past couple of years, the Federal Reserve aggressively raised its key interest rate to a 23-year high to beat down inflation.
Now that inflation has slowed substantially and is expected to cool further, the central bank is expected to embark on a rate-cutting campaign over the next two years, starting as early as September.
If it does, rates should decline on a wide swath of financial products for Americans, from credit cards and home loans to bank accounts and certificates of deposit, among others.
Given how many ways lower rates can affect your finances, here are some things to consider when deciding what steps to take in response.
## Timing and magnitude matter .
The prospect of lower borrowing costs will be welcome news to those seeking loans or anyone trying to reduce their existing debt loads.
But, realistically, how much you'll save when the Fed lowers rates will depend on how quickly it cuts and by how much each time.
The answer for the near term is most likely to be “not that much.”.
“Interest rates took the elevator going up, but they will take the stairs coming down,” said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.
By that he means: “Rates are not going to fall fast enough to bail you out of a bad situation [this year],” McBride said.
“And for savers, [the initial declines] won't wipe out your interest earnings.
Savers will still be way ahead of the game.”.
That's because one or even two quarter-point rate cuts this year won't meaningfully reduce many of your interest costs.
But several cuts over the next year or two could make a noticeable difference, and it may be worth holding your fire on some moves until then.
“Don't jump the gun too early on this stuff,” said Chris Diodato, a fee-only certified financial planner and founder of WELLth Financial Planning.
Here's a breakdown of how lower rates may affect key areas of your financial life, along with tips from Diodato and McBride on what to do about it.
Getting a mortgage is one of the biggest financial moves most people ever make.
Mortgage rates are influenced by a number of economic factors, and the Fed's moves are one.
Since loan amounts are substantial, this is one area where even small cuts in interest rates could make a meaningful difference in what a homebuyer will pay.
For those buying a home this year, you may be tempted to buy down points to reduce your mortgage rate.
Before doing so, Diodato advised, crunch some numbers to make sure it will actually save you money if you think you may be tempted to refinance in a year or two should rates drop further.
That's because you will pay thousands of dollars to buy down your mortgage rate now, and then thousands more in fees to refinance.
To buy down a quarter of a point might cost you 1% of your loan or 4% for a full point, he said.
To refi, the costs could be higher — they typically run between 2% and 6% of your loan, according to Lending Tree.
Given that mortgage rates have fallen at least 1.25% in every rate-cutting cycle since 1971, and often over 2% or 3%, Diodato sees it this way: “Buying your rate down a quarter of a percentage point, or even a full percentage point, wouldn't stop most people from wanting to refinance at some point during the next rate-cut cycle.
So, my rationale is not to saddle folks with both paying for points and then the costs of a refinance.”.
As for taking out a home equity line of credit, be aware that it's no longer cheap money to borrow: The current average rate range for HELOCs is roughly 9% to 11%.
A couple of quarter-point rate cuts from the Fed won't make it meaningfully cheaper, McBride said.
“Americans are sitting on more equity than ever, but you have to be judicious about how you tap into it, given how much it costs to borrow against it.
Just because you have equity doesn't make it free money.”.
Of course, if you're just taking out a HELOC to serve as an emergency lifeline and you never tap it, the rate may be less of a concern.
But it still may cost you money by way of closing costs, any requirement that you withdraw a minimum amount at closing, or any other ancillary fees for having the line, such as an annual fee or inactivity fee, McBride noted.
And if you already owe money on a HELOC, he suggested, “aggressively pay it down.
It's high-cost debt that won't get cheaper soon.”.
Another perpetually high-cost form of debt is your unpaid credit card balance s .
A few rate cuts won't make much of a dent in today's record-high average rate of 20.7%.
Even if rate cuts ultimately push down the average to where it was at the start of 2022 — 16.3% — it will still be a pricey loan.
That's why, if you're carrying credit card debt, the advice is the same as it has always been: If you qualify, sign up for a zero-rate balance transfer card that can buy you at least 12 to 18 months interest free so you can meaningfully pay down the principal you owe.
If that proves difficult to get, see if you can transfer your balance to a credit card from a credit union or local bank that offers lower rates than the biggest banks.
“They typically have fewer perks, but their rates can be half as high,” Dodiato said.
If you want to finance the purchase of a new car, a rate-cutting environment may not help as much as you think.
McBride notes that every quarter point cut knocks $4 a month off a typical loan for a $35,000 car.
So a full percentage point drop amounts to just $16 a month, or less than $200 a year.
“Your real lever for savings is the price of the car you choose, how much you're financing and your credit rating,” he said.
As for leasing a car, McBride noted, the effect of a Fed rate cut may be equally small on the so-called “money factor” you will pay to lease, and because many variables determine what that factor will be, it will be hard to figure out the impact of lower interest rates.
The past year has been very good for anyone who parked cash in online high-yield savings accounts, many of which have been paying north of 5%.
The same goes for those who could lock up their cash for certain periods of time in certificates of deposits or Treasuries, many durations of which were also paying north of 5%..
While those rates will start to come down when the Fed starts cutting rates, the drops aren't likely to be huge at first — meaning you will still be able to earn more on your savings than the rate of inflation for a while, McBride predicts.
But it may no longer make sense to leave quite as much cash in these types of vehicles going forward.
“I caution people against the cash trap.
A lot of people, used to these nice savings rates, were diverting money from stocks and longer-term bonds,” said Diodato, who predicts yields on savings will eventually fall to 3% in the next two years.
His advice: Don't keep more than six months' to a year's worth of living expenses in cash or cash equivalents.
“Anything more than that and you're putting a drag on your future net worth,” he said.
That said, McBride suggested that if you're within five years of retirement, you might want to lock in some high rates still on offer today to grow the cash you'll want to cover living expenses in the first few years after you stop working.
Having that cash on hand means you won't be forced to pull from your longer-term portfolio should there be a big market downturn at the start of your retirement .
For instance, many CDs with durations of two, three, four or five years are currently paying between 4.85% and 5% on Schwab.com.
If you do opt for such a longer-term CD, try to find one that is not “callable.”
A callable CD is one that the issuer can decide to close out before its maturity date, which might happen if rates fall considerably during the next few years.
“The call feature is a 'Heads I win, tails you lose' for the issuing bank,” McBride said.

Title: Paris Men's Fashion Week: Fashion gets a political makeover | CNN
# Paris Men's Fashion Week: Fashion gets a political makeover | CNN.
Editor's Note: CNN Style is one of the official media partners of Paris Fashion Week .
See all coverage here .
Paris CNN — .
As Paris Men's Fashion Week kicked off — one day after the second inauguration of US President Donald Trump and amid the rising power of France's populist right — focusing on clothing might seem a touch frivolous.
Yet throughout the week, designers demonstrated their ability to engage with a larger societal landscape; by addressing concerns about inclusivity, protection and freedom, the Fall-Winter 2025 season provided a stage to escape as well as ideas to navigate the current climate.
From Willy Chavarria to EgonLab or Comme des Garçons Homme Plus, messages of unity and acceptance were sent down the runways.
When the “French population feels increasingly powerless in the face of the government, fashion's soft power, as an industry and an art, lies in its capacity to produce new discourses, images and impact other industries,” Carole Boinet, director of French cultural publication Les Inrockuptibles, told CNN . .
On the runways, workwear came back with a bang, reimagined and fused with contemporary wardrobes.
As bearded models in plaid shirts, raw denim and lumberjack-inspired lines walked the Junya Watanabe runway, the figure of the hipster seemed to hail back to 2010, when the aesthetic permeated youth subcultures and became a global phenomenon.
But it was “good old workwear originally crafted for forestry workers,” as outlined in the show notes, that was on the Japanese designer's mind.
With that, the collection reflected the season's running themes: the great outdoors and function in outerwear.
At Louis Vuitton, men's creative director Pharrell Williams teamed up with Nigo, the designer of LVMH fashion stablemate Kenzo and founder of Japanese fashion brand A Bathing Ape, to co-design a collection that merged workwear and sportswear.
Inspired by the practical wardrobes of engineers, chefs and gardeners, the clothing — including a double-breasted indigo blue denim jacket, a striped box-cut ensemble and a baby pink sleeveless blouson — were both elevated and practical.
Inspired by Maurice Sendak's 1963 children's book, “Where the Wild Things are,” Sacai founder and designer Chitose Abe, who has built a global business with her penchant for hybrid materials and oversized silhouettes, played with “ideas of living in nature, untamed and unrestricted by convention.”
She showed a collection of cocoon-shaped furry knitwear, some with exaggerated pockets, and also continued to create co-branded pieces with US workwear company Carhartt, which took the form of leather and puffer jackets in shades of dark brown and green.
Throughout the week, designers used their platforms to make overt political and social statements.
New York-based designer Willy Chavarria, a recent winner of the CFDA's Menswear Designer of the Year Award, brought his collection to Paris for the first time, to mark the tenth anniversary of his eponymous label.
Shown in the baroque setting of the American Cathedral, his sculpted, reworked tailoring once again took inspiration from his Mexican-American background; they came in a palette of gold, plum and burgundy.
As Chavarria explained to CNN, resilience and resistance was at the heart of his collection, as he sought to put forward a “message of human dignity and equality.”
He emphasized “the importance of us coming together to preserve our rights as citizens, as immigrants, as LGBTQ people, as women, all of us who are very much under attack right now.”.
Florentin Glémarec and Kevin Nompeix, the creative duo behind the Paris-based gender-fluid label EgonLab, incorporated playful Victorian nods as they presented garments that challenged traditional masculinity.
Backstage, the designers explained their focus on disenfranchised communities.
“ Minorities are systematically attacked by new politics around the world,” they said, adding that amid what felt like “a modern witch hunt,” they called for “minorities to unite and fight inequality.” .
At Comme des Garçons Homme Plus, war was on the mind of Japanese fashion designer Rei Kawakubo, whose collection, named “To Hell With War,” showcased deconstructed army staples, disheveled khaki uniforms and army boots.
Models wore reimagined helmets adorned with flowers, reminiscent of the flower power movement of the 1960s and '70s, when protesters focused on positive values, such as peace and love, in their fight for freedom.
Charles Jeffrey, founder and designer of London fashion label Charles Jeffrey Loverboy, drew inspiration from Berlin's Weimar Cabarets.
With exaggerated stage makeup, homoerotic banana-shaped accessories and a peel-like effect on garments, deconstructed kilts and disheveled knitwear, the designer — who opened the show in heels and spoke to spectators via a microphone — sought to echo the label's roots in nightlife.
For designer Jeffrey, it was “an opportunity to make people come together… when we have right-wing governments saying, 'you are only two genders'…we are a multitude of things,” he told CNN ahead of the show.
Some designers took a more introspective approach, focusing on the narratives embedded in clothing and tailoring details that might go amiss on camera.
Dior's collection referenced the H-line created by its founder Christian Dior for Fall-Winter 1954-1955 - a controversial silhouette at the time as its flattened shape appeared, for some, unfeminine.
In a cinematic setting, models descended with dramatic covered eyes, à la Stanley Kubrick's 1999 erotic psychological drama “Eyes Wide Shut.”
The collection also played with contrasting volumes from baggy male skirts to opera coats and dusted pink bows.
Bianca Saunders, the first Black British designer to win the prestigious ANDAM fashion prize, looked at the tension between constraint and movement, and suppleness and rigor, Shirts were creased, trousers' seams were twisted and their ankles were knotted. ..
Citing Robert Longo's photography, which captures men and women in exaggerated, contorted movements, she said that she took inspiration from “ how very structural menswear is pushed and pulled, all that subtlety of twisting things… capturing movement and slowness in the garment.” .
Craftsmanship and experimentation also took center stage at Rick Owens' show at the Palais de Tokyo.
True to form, Owens distorted and exaggerated body shapes while radically playing with techniques and textures — see the “dracucollar” jackets in wax-drummed leather, “megacrust” jeans, a crusted effect achieved by pressing bronze foil and wax onto denim, and even kemp fibers - an eco-friendly and subversive material also known as 'dead hair'.
As it often is with Owens, fashion knows no bounds.

Title: AiScout: Top soccer clubs are using a mobile app to find future stars | CNN Business
# AiScout: Top soccer clubs are using a mobile app to find future stars | CNN Business.
London CNN — .
A London-based technology company is looking to “democratize” talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app.
Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills.
It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them.
Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology.
The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch.
The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills.
“We're putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts'] time,” said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app.
“To say [to scouts], 'Go over to this place today because there's three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard' — that's going to be the best use of your time.'”.
It already appears to be working for some.
Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019.
After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club.
He signed a contract with EPL team Bournemouth in 2021.
Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app — which fully launched in September 2023 — according to Felton-Thomas.
Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year.
Felton-Thomas said the “lion's share” of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform.
Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for “tier one” sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid.
The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes.
The global market for sports analytics, valued at $2.7 billion in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research.
Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry?
For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods.
“It's more about evolution than revolution,” Felton-Thomas explained.
“We can't tell you when that player's actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity?
What happens when he's 2-0 down?
What happens when someone's shouting at him?
What happens when he's just made a massive mistake?”.
“We've got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you're still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.”.
While football remains ai.io's primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years.
Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports.
“You think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,” Felton-Thomas told CNN.

Title: Why DeepSeek could mark a turning point for Silicon Valley on AI | CNN Business
# Why DeepSeek could mark a turning point for Silicon Valley on AI | CNN Business.
New York CNN — .
Silicon Valley is coming to grips this week with the realization that creating an advanced artificial intelligence model may no longer be as specialized a task as was once believed.
The wakeup call came in the form of DeepSeek, a year-old Chinese start-up whose free, open-source AI model, R1, is more or less on par with advanced models from American tech giants — and it was built for a fraction of the cost, apparently with less advanced chips and it demands far less data center power to run. .
Until now, the widely accepted wisdom in the US tech world was that American tech giants could stay ahead by spending billions of dollars, amassing advanced chips and building out huge data centers (despite the environmental cost ).
Essentially, because they're among the richest companies in the world, they believed they could throw more resources at the problem than anyone else and come out on top.
Now, all of that has been called into question .
And tech giants are facing tough questions from Wall Street.
The name of the AI game may no longer be winning with the most expensive, ever-more powerful models.
“The paradigm is shifting,” said Zack Kass, an AI consultant and former OpenAI go-to-market lead.
“It's so hard to own a scientific breakthrough” such as an AI model advancement, Kass said, and prevent competitors from catching up.
Instead, tech companies may now find themselves competing to lower costs and build more helpful applications for consumers and corporate customers — and also to suck up less power and natural resources in the process. .
At least one American tech leader has already promised to respond to DeepSeek by speeding up the release of more powerful models.
OpenAI CEO Sam Altman called DeepSeek's R1 model “impressive” in an X post Monday, adding that “we will pull up some releases” of new models in response.
OpenAI Chief Product Officer Kevin Weil also said the company's upcoming o3 model, set to launch in the coming weeks, would “be another major step up.” .
“It's a super competitive industry, right?
And this is showing that it's competitive globally, not just within the US,” Weil said on a call with reporters about OpenAI's new ChatGPT offering for government agencies, in response to a question from CNN. “
We're committed to moving really quickly here.
We want to stay ahead.”.
But analysts also expect the Big Tech companies to scale back their data center spending plans and potentially rethink how much they're charging consumers.
DeepSeek has proved it's possible to provide the technology at a lesser cost, although some industry experts have raised eyebrows at the startup's claims about spending just under $6 million to build its model.
OpenAI's largest investor, Microsoft, is investigating whether DeepSeek trained its model off of stolen OpenAI data, Bloomberg reported .
Even if the company achieved its efficiency revolution with some malfeasance, DeepSeek's achievements have lit a fire under Silicon Valley's AI industry.
“All those other frontier model labs — OpenAI, Anthropic, Google — are going to build far more efficient models based on what they're learning from DeepSeek,” said Gil Luria, head of technology research at investment firm D.A. Davidson.
“And you'll be able to use those at a fraction of the price that you can now, because it's going to be a fraction of the cost to run those models.”.
To be sure, the industry was almost certainly going to eventually shift its focus to “efficiency” — working to add AI capabilities using a set amount of computing power versus adding more servers to juice the technology.
There are only so many computers you can build and only so much electricity available to service them.
And an AI tool can only get so proficient at, say, writing emails or planning trips, before making it marginally more powerful is no longer worthwhile.
But DeepSeek appears to have sped up that timeline.
And in Silicon Valley, unwinding spending on data centers could be tricky.
Just last week, OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank visited the White House to announce the creation of a new company and a $500 million investment in US AI infrastructure; Microsoft CEO Sundar Pichai affirmed he was “good for” his company's planned $80 billion investment in AI development and infrastructure this year; and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said his company's AI spending could reach as much as $65 billion this year.
“That crazy AI data center build-out that we've been talking about for the last couple of years?
They don't need to do that anymore.
They can build a lot less because they can provide a lot more services at a much lower price,” Luria said.
He added that investors will likely expect to hear about those plans in the American tech companies' earnings calls over the next two weeks.
Of course, if the tech giants cut data center costs for training AI models — and therefore charge customers less — their tools will get used more, putting more inference (or people asking questions) strain on the data centers, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts wrote Tuesday.
So just how dramatic that pullback on data center spending might be remains to be seen. .
Some tech leaders say they're looking at DeepSeek as validation — rather than a threat.
Proponents of open-source AI — where the model's underlying architecture is made publicly available, rather than charged for — say the Chinese model is proof that American companies should be sharing their innovations rather than gatekeeping them.
That way, the whole US field could advance more quickly and remain the technology standard around the world.
“The United States already has the best closed models in the world.
To remain competitive, we must also support the development of a vibrant open-source ecosystem,” former Google CEO Eric Schmidt wrote in a Washington Post op-ed Tuesday.
Meta, which has pushed open-source AI with its Llama model, also said such models are “driving a significant shift in the industry, and that's going to bring the benefits of AI to everyone faster.”.
And even if DeepSeek forces a short-term rethinking of the business model Silicon Valley had envisioned for AI, people who believe the technology will change the world should be glad for the advancement, Kass said.
“We are freaked out fairly, I suppose, because we thought we had global AI supremacy, when, in fact, we should be celebrating,” Kass said.
“Because this is one more piece of evidence that the AI revolution is going to democratize technology and it's going to be fairly distributed.”.

Save the Music, the nonprofit foundation that grew in popularity on cable TV in the late 1990s through the 2000s, is going indie.
Paramount Global is ending its financial support for the nearly 30-year-old program that promotes music education in public schools, the foundation announced Wednesday.
As a result, Save the Music is starting a $10 million endowment fund to sustain its mission as a fully independent nonprofit.
The change marks the end of an era for the organization, which was created in 1997 by a former VH1 executive and became a mainstay on the cable network's programming slate.
It spanned highly rated benefit concerts like “VH1 Divas Live” to TV ads fronted by A-list singers, including Celine Dion and Mariah Carey.
Paramount's decision to nix funding comes during a financially perilous time for the storied media conglomerate.
Last year, the company laid off 15% of its US staff and wrote down $6 billion in value of its cable television networks as part of its efforts to eliminate $500 million in annual costs.
It's also in the midst of an $8.4 billion merger with Skydance Media.
Given all of that, Paramount's decision to end its relationship with the foundation was for “obvious reasons,” Save the Music's Executive Director Harry Donahue told CNN.
The media company has made a final six-figure donation to its endowment, he said.
“Save the Music was founded nearly 30 years ago and since then, it has helped millions of students at more than 2,800 schools excel both academically and creatively through the enriching power of music,” a Paramount spokesperson said in a statement.
“We're honored to have been a part of this critical mission from the beginning, and we're excited to see Save the Music continue to thrive in this next chapter.”.
Donahue said the change has “been in the cards” since 2019 when Save the Music dropped VH1 from its name and reduced its reliance on a single source for money.
Currently, 95% of its budget comes from non-Paramount sources by garnering donations from major companies, including Amazon, TikTok and Meta; major record labels; and philanthropists such as MacKenzie Scott , who gave the foundation $2 million.
Nearly $4 million of the $10 million endowment is currently funded.
Also since 2019, it began to tweak its approach to funding and promoting music education, he said.
Under Paramount ( formerly Viacom ), Save the Music harnessed the popularity and viewership that VH1 used to have, noting that the “VH1 Divas Live” concert series was created to fund the program.
The foundation “would travel around the country with artists and celebrities dropping off instruments at schools and they would have, like what I would call the 'classic Oprah moment,' where you have a school assembly and there's a star there,” Donahue said.
“They pull a big sheet off a big pile of instruments on the stage and everybody goes crazy.
We really don't do that anymore.”.
Rather than focus on made-for-TV moments, Save the Music now embeds in communities and schools — some of which have been the victim of cutbacks within art and music programs — and creates investment plans to help fund instruments donations or music classes.
Of course, high-profile musicians will remain part of its mission with “artist ambassadors” making appearances at schools, including Ed Sheeran and Charlie Puth in recent years.
“The objective and the mission has always been the same, which is we think every student and every school should be making music as part of their education,” Donahue said.
“The way we do it now is very, very different.”.

New York CNN — .
It's one of the more obviously flawed ideas embraced by both President Donald Trump and his right-hand man Elon Musk: that government should be run like a business.
Synergies!
Streamlining!
Above all, efficiency — that is the operative word that will help transform the federal government from a hulking, bloated bureaucracy into a nimble machine, like swapping a 1995 Compaq desktop PC for a 2025 MacBook Pro.
Of course, Trump and Musk are applying a business playbook to a thing that is decidedly not a business.
Governments don't work for profit, and the services they provide aren't supposed to wow shareholders or go viral on TikTok.
Good government should fade into the background, unnoticed, so that Americans don't have to think twice about whether it's safe to get on a commercial flight or drink water from their tap.
That's not to say government agencies are perfectly calibrated.
But not all redundancies can be written off as needless red tape.
A leading commission on aviation safety, for one, was widely seen as an asset in bringing the sprawling US industry into alignment.
Trump disbanded it last week.
Less than two weeks in, and it's clear Trump is running the White House with the same dictatorial energy he brought to his companies — almost all of which have been privately held, with no outside board or public shareholders to cater to.
It's a style that also seems to suit Musk, who oversees half a dozen private companies and one public entity, Tesla (where he has stacked his board with loyalists and where he has regularly butted heads with shareholders)..
In the name of efficiency, the president and Musk are putting on a familiar show of cleaning house — a tactic so clearly modeled after Musk's past endeavors, they didn't even bother to change the subject line. .
On Day One, the head of the Federal Aviation Administration, who had publicly clashed with Musk over issues related to SpaceX, stepped down.
The post remained vacant for nine days.
It was only after 67 people were killed in a midair collision over the Potomac River in Washington that Trump announced the appointment of Chris Rocheleau, an FAA veteran who most recently ran an aviation business lobby, to lead the agency.
On his second day in office, Trump fired the heads of the Transportation Security Administration and Coast Guard, cutting both their terms short.
On Day Three, all members of a crucial aviation safety committee received a memo, per the AP , saying that the Department of Homeland Security was terminating the group as part of its “commitment to eliminating the misuse of resources and ensuring that DHS activities prioritize our national security.” (The advisory, by the way, was ordered by Congress more than 30 years ago in response to the Pan Am 103 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland, and brought together key groups in the aviation industry to advise the TSA on the most effective safety protocols.) .
Day Seven, trillions in federal funding were frozen indefinitely.
Day Eight, the US government did a carbon copy of Musk's Twitter playbook when it emailed 2 million federal workers with an offer to resign — once again sparking confusion and panic.
Among those 2 million workers were some 11,500 air-traffic controllers who have been stretched thin for years, often working overtime and battling burnout.
Last year, the FAA said it was still short 3,000 controllers , despite a surge in hiring.
Ten days in, and the sturdy bureaucracy — the folks tasked with keeping planes in the air, ensuring water is drinkable, providing housing to veterans, any number of other essential services — is in chaos.
And while the cause of the plane crash, just a few miles from the White House near Reagan National Airport, is not yet known, it is testing the new administration's response to a crisis at its own doorstep.
Unsurprisingly, Trump defaulted to a well-worn page of the playbook, heaping blame on his predecessors and suggesting that diversity initiatives eroded aviation standards — a statement that is just not true and, as usual, he offered no evidence.
Neither did Vice President JD Vance, or Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, or Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who all parroted the boss.
Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of federal workers are trying to do their jobs while weighing the offer to simply reply to an email with “resign” and walk away.
The offer purports to allow workers to leave with eight months of pay and benefits, though many questioned whether the offer was genuine or even legal.
That anguish appears to be part of the plan.
Russ Vought, Trump's acting head of the Office of Management and Budget, has stated plainly in private speeches revealed by ProPublica last year that “we want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected.” .
“When they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work because they are increasingly viewed as the villains.
We want their funding to be shut down…
We want to put them in trauma.”.

Title: Pentagon to swap traditional media with pro-Trump outlets under new rotational program for Defense Department workspace | CNN Business
# Pentagon to swap traditional media with pro-Trump outlets under new rotational program for Defense Department workspace | CNN Business.
CNN — .
One America News Network would soon replace NBC News and Breitbart would swap with National Public Radio in coveted Pentagon press corps workspace under a plan shared with journalists Friday night.
In what the Pentagon is calling a new “annual media rotation program,” The New York Post will also be invited to move into The New York Times' workspace.
And a fourth outlet affected by the rotation program, Politico, would be replaced by HuffPost.
Three of the changes, set to take effect on February 14, elevate relatively small and ardently pro-Trump media outlets while sidelining more popular, more mainstream news organizations.
The fourth is the exception: HuffPost, which has a progressive brand, is openly critical of President Donald Trump.
Curiously, though, the site does not currently have a Pentagon correspondent.
“If the Trump Administration and Secretary Hegseth are interested in more hard-hitting coverage of their stewardship of the Defense Department from HuffPost, we are ready to deliver,” a HuffPost spokesperson said Friday night.
NBC News said in a statement, “We're disappointed by the decision to deny us access to a broadcasting booth at the Pentagon that we've used for many decades.
Despite the significant obstacles this presents to our ability to gather and report news in the national public interest, we will continue to report with the same integrity and rigor NBC News always has.”.
CNN has reached out to representatives for The New York Times, NPR and Politico for comment.
The Friday night announcement is bound to provoke challenges from members of the Pentagon press corps.
But it is in line with the Trump administration's stated goals to challenge long-held norms and create space for new, opinionated online media outlets.
Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Ullyot said in the internal memo to the Pentagon Press Association that the changes apply to individual office spaces in the “Correspondents' Corridor” at the Defense Department — both a practical and symbolic move.
The year-by-year rotation program will “broaden access to the limited space of the Correspondents' Corridor to outlets that have not previously enjoyed the privilege and journalistic value of working from physical office space in the Pentagon,” Ullyot wrote.
Officials apparently chose one outlet “from each press medium” — print, online, radio and TV — to forfeit their existing space for one years' time.
The news outlets that are being replaced were effectively given two weeks' notice.
Members of the Pentagon press corps were left wondering why The Times, NBC, NPR and Politico were told to vacate the office space, and whether the decisions were related to their rigorous coverage of new Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, the former Fox News host who took charge at the Pentagon earlier this week.
“To be clear, the outlets that vacate the spaces loaned to them” by the defense secretary “will remain as full members of the Pentagon Press Corps,” Ullyot wrote.
“They will continue to enjoy the same media access to the Pentagon and will be able to attend and cover briefings and be considered for travel with civilian and military leaders in the Department as they have previously.
The only change will be giving up their physical workspaces in the building to allow new outlets to have their turn to become resident members of the Pentagon Press Corps.”.
Ullyot's memo billed the rotation system as a fair way to welcome more media outlets into US military headquarters, but the announcement came under immediate scrutiny.
Breitbart, for example, was selected as a radio outlet, replacing NPR this year.
But Breitbart - a well-known web site for pro-Trump coverage and commentary - barely has a radio operation of its own.
The word “radio” doesn't appear on its home page at all.
The media outlet has a distribution deal with SiriusXM and one big podcast, Breitbart News Daily.
Its footprint pales in comparison to NPR, which provides news coverage for local stations all across the country.
One America News was selected as TV outlet, replacing NBC this year.
While NBC produces some of the most-watched news programs in the country, like “NBC Nightly News” and “Today,” One America is so small that it eschewed the Nielsen ratings measurement service.
The far-right channel, headquartered in San Diego, faced multiple lawsuits stemming from the outlet's lies about the 2020 election.
Kevin Baron, a former vice president of the Pentagon Press Association, called the development “the erasure of journalism at the Pentagon.”.
“Kicking out reporters HURTS coverage.
If you can't file your stories from inside the building you are disadvantaged.
If you don't have a work space you are disadvantaged,” Baron said in a series of posts on X .
The National Press Club, an advocate for press freedom, said in a statement that it was troubled by the Pentagon's announcement and called on the Defense Department to provide greater clarity about the decision.
“The National Press Club is deeply concerned by the Defense Department's decision to remove certain media organizations from their dedicated spaces in the Pentagon,” National Press Club President Mike Balsamo said in a statement.
“Any action that restricts the ability of journalists to report on the operations of the U.S. government should alarm all who value transparency and press freedom.”.

Title: Microplastics are choking our waters.

# Microplastics are choking our waters.
Could a sponge made of squid bones help remove them?
| CNN.
CNN — .
Microplastics are everywhere.
They have been found on the peak of Mount Everest and in creatures inhabiting the deepest trenches of the sea .
They're in bottled water , human placentas and breast milk .
These tiny plastic particles choke wildlife, disrupt ecosystems, and threaten human health - and they are notoriously difficult to remove.
But scientists in China have come up with a possible solution: a biodegradable sponge made of squid bones and cotton.
A research team from Wuhan University used chitin from squid bones and cellulose from cotton - two organic compounds known for eliminating pollution from wastewater - to create a biodegradable sponge.
They then tested the sponge in four different water samples, taken from irrigation water, pond water, lake water and sea water, and found it removed up to 99.9% of microplastics, according to a study published last month in Science Advances. .
“The planet is under great threat from microplastics, and aquatic ecosystems are the first to suffer,” wrote the authors.
“Even under a variety of policies, including plastic product reduction, waste management, and environmental recycling, microplastic pollution is irreversible and escalating.”.
Microplastics are tiny shards of plastic smaller than 5 millimeters.
They come from everything from tires, which are then broken down into smaller pieces, to microbeads, a plastic found in beauty products such as exfoliants.
One study from 2020 estimated there are 14 million metric tons of microplastics sitting on the ocean floor. .
Scientists have called microplastics “one of this generation's key environmental challenges” and the problem is an internationally recognized environmental issue.
Plastic is a persistent pollution that hurts wildlife, the ocean itself and there's growing concern about the potential health risks it poses to humans.
The problem is only set to get worse with plastic production and pollution expected to increase in the coming years.
Even if we embarked on an immediate and globally coordinated effort to reduce plastic consumption, an estimated 710 million metric tons of plastic would still pollute the environment by 2040, according to another study.
That makes finding solutions to get rid of the plastics contaminating our oceans all the more urgent.
The sponge created by the Wuhan researchers was able to absorb microplastics both by physically intercepting them and through electromagnetic attraction, the study said.
Previously studied methods for absorbing plastics tend to be expensive and difficult to make, limiting their scalability.
Last year, researchers in Qingdao, China developed a synthetic sponge made of starch and gelatin designed to remove microplastics from water, though its efficacy varied depending on water conditions.
The low cost and wide availability of both cotton and squid bones mean the sponge created in Wuhan “has great potential to be used in the extraction of microplastic from complex water bodies,” according to the study.
Shima Ziajahromi, a lecturer at Australia's Griffith University who studies microplastics, called the squid-cotton-sponge method “promising” and said it could be an effective way to “clean up the high risk and vulnerable aquatic ecosystem.”.
However, the study's authors did not address whether the sponge can remove microplastics that sink to the sediment, which is the majority of microplastics in our waters, said Ziajahromi, who was not involved in the study.
Another “critical issue” is the proper disposal of the sponges, Ziajahromi said.
“Although the material is biodegradable, the microplastics it absorbs need to be disposed of properly,” she said.
“Without careful management, this process risks transferring microplastics from one ecosystem to another.”.
Ultimately, Ziajahromi added, minimizing plastic pollution is in the first place should remain a “top priority.”.

# From Venezuela to the US border: This family hoped for asylum in America.
Now they don't know where to go | CNN.
Ciudad Juarez, Mexico CNN — .
The main room in the El Buen Samaritano shelter in Ciudad Juarez, a city along the US-Mexico border, is quiet for most of the day.
Rows of bunk beds stretch from wall to wall, each separated by thin curtains or hanging sheets.
The mismatched mattresses are occupied by men, women, and children - all migrants who intended to reach the United States but haven't completed their journey.
It's the mid-morning of a cold Tuesday, most are resting or scrolling through their phones, the only noises in the room come from sporadic coughs, two children playing, and the subtle sounds from a video playing on a phone.
The scene feels like a loop.
At around 1 o'clock, Lucymar Polanco, a 32-year-old Venezuelan woman, checks her watch.
“Kids, guys, it's almost lunchtime,” she yells as she gets up and puts on a coat.
They're indoors but the walls are penetrated by the winter cold.
“Everyone up, let's get ready,” she says.
Her husband, her three kids, and five other relatives, all start getting ready enthusiastically.
Soon after, a shelter worker announces the food is ready to be served.
“I'm hungry, finally!” her 9-year-old son Abel Jesus, says.
Polanco and the other nine members of her family are among thousands of asylum-seekers who were stopped in their tracks by US President Donald Trump's January 20 decision to cancel all CBP One appointments for people seeking asylum from violence or persecution.
Their appointment had been set for January 21.
Now, they are stranded in the shelter in Juarez with no money and full of uncertainty.
From here, they can see across the border into the US - but they have no idea where to go now.
For the moment, the only thing they know is that it's time to eat.
After lining up, the family - whose members range in age from 5 to 40 - head to the shelter's dining hall.
They sit together and occupy most of a communal table.
As soon as they sit, they seem to put all their problems aside and focus on one another, on talking and enjoying the warm meal.
The day's menu: chicken soup and a small dish of rice and beans with canned tuna.
“The most delicious soup does exist,” 9-year-old Abel Jesus says with his mouth half-full and soup dripping from the edge of his mouth.
The adults chat and mostly talk about rumors they've heard about the CBP One app.
“I heard appointments until January 30 will be reinstated,” Luis Alfonso Polanco, 30, says of a rumor that later proved to be untrue.
“That's what a friend in the US told me.”.
On the other side of the table, his partner Yelitza Olivero talks to two other migrants from Ecuador and shares the rumor about the app with them.
At times, the family's border chatter turns into laughter and jokes about one another.
“We try to make jokes about each other, it's a way of distracting from the news we received on January 20, it was very sad,” Lucymar's cousin, 18-year-old Estiven Castillo, says.
“The point is to support one another, so one makes a joke, and we laugh, and we try to make a nice moment, otherwise, if we just focus on our situation, we'd all get depressed, so we laugh to keep from crying,” Lucymar tells CNN.
## Surviving the Darien gap and the cartels .
Lucymar and her family say they fled the Venezuelan state of Lara due to political persecution from authoritarian President Nicolas Maduro's government.
“We were part of an opposing political party,” she says.
“My family, my parents, everyone there, and the government knew that, and we'd constantly be threatened.”.
“I was set to receive a house from a program run by the government but after they found out who I voted for in prior elections, they took that benefit away from me,” she says holding back tears.
Prior to leaving Venezuela, both Lucymar and her brother, Luis Alfonso, worked in the beauty industry.
“I was a barber in Venezuela, but things were so bad that at times I cut hair in exchange for food,” Luis Alfonso says.
Lucymar's husband, Jesus Caruci, 40, worked as a mechanic, and Yelitza, who's married to Luis Alfonso, worked in sales.
The rest of the traveling family, all young adults or children, were in school before leaving the country.
Their journey began a little over two years ago.
They spent a few months in neighboring Colombia to later trek through several countries.
They crossed the treacherous Darien Gap safely - but were kidnapped by a cartel after arriving in southern Mexico.
“When we entered Tapachula, they were waiting for us,” Luis Alfonso recalls.
“They tricked us, they forced us into a vehicle and said they were taking us to a safe place (…) but they took us to a farm and held us there for six days.”.
Luis Alfonso says the criminal group only released after they paid $900 - all that they were carrying.
“Ever since we've survived with some money our family has sent us or that we've had to borrow,” he says.
## 'Trump, take our country and call it Venezuela of America' .
After sobremesa , the family goes to the shelter's patio to get some sun and continue to chat.
They gather several plastic chairs that are spread out through the uneven and cracked shelter pavement and form a circle.
The little kids decide to run around and play in an outdoor playset.
“I understand Trump,” says 19-year-old Beyker Sosa as the family stays quiet.
“There have been crimes done by illegal migrants, I understand the measures, they are meant to keep the country safe,” he adds.
“But we aren't criminals, I wish he (Trump) would have compassion, we are humans just like him.”.
CNN asked the family if they ever considered entering the US illegally and in chorus, they all said “no.”.
“We never considered entering illegally, we never want to hide from authorities, we wanted to be able to walk free,” Beyker says.
“It's very sad to have done things right, the legal way, only to have Trump shut the app down, but I guess God doesn't want us there.”.
The family says their smartphones and conversation are their only form of entertainment in the shelter.
“We can't even go out, we were warned that migrants are targeted in this area, so we just stay in, especially after already being kidnapped,” Lucymar says.
Still, with kids to entertain, snacks are a must.
Luis Alfonso and Estiven go to a store around the corner to buy cookies and soda.
As they return, they rejoin the conversation and start passing around Oreos and a plastic cup with orange soda.
“Trump should clean up Venezuela, we are good people, but he should up take out the bad ones, especially those in the government, take them out, Trump, and then take our country and call it Venezuela of America,” Beyker jokes as he refers to Trump's bid to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America.
Nearly two hours later, the family is back in the main room of the shelter with each settling into their beds again.
“This is all we do, we are either in our beds, on our phones, we wonder what could've been,” Lucymar says.

Title: Doomsday Clock 2025: Scientists set new time | CNN
# Doomsday Clock 2025: Scientists set new time | CNN.
Sign up for CNN's Life, But Greener newsletter.
Our limited newsletter series guides you on how to minimize your personal role in the climate crisis — and reduce your eco-anxiety . .
CNN — .
Seventy-eight years ago, scientists created a unique sort of timepiece — named the Doomsday Clock — as a symbolic attempt to gauge how close humanity is to destroying the world.
On Tuesday, the clock was set at 89 seconds to midnight — the closest the world has ever been to that marker, according to the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, which established the clock in 1947.
Midnight represents the moment at which people will have made the Earth uninhabitable.
For the two years prior, the Bulletin set the clock at 90 seconds to midnight mainly due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine , the potential of a nuclear arms race, the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza , and the climate crisis .
The clock isn't designed to definitively measure existential threats but rather to spark conversations about difficult scientific topics such as climate change, according to the Bulletin. .
“We set the clock closer to midnight because we do not see sufficient, positive progress on the global challenges we face, including nuclear risk, climate change, biological threats and advances in disruptive technologies” such as artificial intelligence , said Daniel Holz, the Bulletin's science and security board chair and professor in the department of physics, astronomy and astrophysics at the University of Chicago, in a news briefing Tuesday.
“The countries that possess nuclear weapons are increasing the size and role of their arsenals, investing hundreds of billions of dollars in weapons that can destroy civilization many times over.” .
Progress in the development of “disruptive technologies,” such as artificial intelligence, biotechnology and in space has also far outpaced regulation in those areas, Holz added.
“All of these dangers are greatly exacerbated by a potent threat multiplier — the spread of misinformation , disinformation and conspiracy theories that degrade the communication ecosystem and increasingly blur the line between truth and falsehood ,” Holz added.
The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists was founded by a group of scientists who worked on the Manhattan Project, the code name for the development of the atomic bomb during World War II.
Originally, the organization was conceived to measure nuclear threats, but in 2007 the Bulletin made the decision to include climate change in its calculations.
Over the last 78 years, the clock's time has changed according to how close scientists believe the human race is to total destruction.
Some years the time changes, and some years it doesn't..
The Doomsday Clock is set every year by experts on the Bulletin's Science and Security Board in consultation with its Board of Sponsors, which was first established by Albert Einstein in December 1948, with J. Robert Oppenheimer as its first chair.
The board currently includes nine Nobel laureates, many of them in physics, physiology or medicine.
The clock has been an effective wake-up call when it comes to reminding people about the cascading crises the planet is facing, but some have questioned its usefulness.
“It's an imperfect metaphor,” Michael E. Mann, Presidential Distinguished Professor in the earth and environmental science department at the University of Pennsylvania, told CNN in 2022, highlighting that the clock's framing combines various types of risk that have different characteristics and occur in different timescales.
Still, he added that it “remains an important rhetorical device that reminds us, year after year, of the tenuousness of our current existence on this planet.”.
Every model has constraints, Eryn MacDonald, an analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists' Global Security Program, told CNN in 2022, adding that the Bulletin has made thoughtful decisions each year on how to get people's attention about existential threats and the required action.
“While I wish we could go back to talking about minutes to midnight instead of seconds, unfortunately that no longer reflects reality,” MacDonald said.
The clock has never reached midnight, and Bulletin president and CEO Rachel Bronson said she hopes it never will.
“When the clock is at midnight, that means there's been some sort of nuclear exchange or catastrophic climate change that's wiped out humanity,” she said.
“We never really want to get there, and we won't know it when we do.”.
Though the clock can't measure threats, if it sparks conversation and encourages public engagement in scientific topics such as climate change and nuclear disarmament, then Bronson views it as a success.
When a new time is set on the clock, people listen, she said.
At the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland in 2021, then-UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson cited the Doomsday Clock when talking about the climate crisis the world is facing, Bronson noted.
Bronson said she hopes people will discuss whether they agree with the Bulletin's decision and have fruitful talks about what the driving forces of the change are.
Moving the clock back with bold, concrete actions is still possible.
In fact, the hand moved the farthest away from midnight — a whopping 17 minutes before the hour — in 1991, when then-President George H.W. Bush's administration signed the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with the Soviet Union. .
“We at the Bulletin believe that because humans created these threats, we can reduce them,” Bronson said.
“But doing so is not easy, nor has it ever been.
And it requires serious work and global engagement at all levels of society.”.
Don't underestimate the power of talking about these important issues with your peers, Bronson said.
“You might not feel it because you're not doing anything, but we know that public engagement moves (a) leader to do things,” she said.
Personal actions can make a difference.
To have a positive impact on climate change, look at your daily habits and see if there are small changes you can make in your life such as how often you walk versus drive and how your home is heated, Bronson said.
Eating seasonally and locally, reducing food waste , conserving water and recycling properly are other ways to help mitigate, or deal with the effects of, the climate crisis.

Title: Stargate: Trump announces a $500 billion AI infrastructure investment in the US | CNN Business
# Stargate: Trump announces a $500 billion AI infrastructure investment in the US | CNN Business.
New York CNN — .
Three top tech firms on Tuesday announced that they will create a new company, called Stargate, to grow artificial intelligence infrastructure in the United States.
OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son and Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison appeared at the White House Tuesday afternoon alongside President Donald Trump to announce the company, which Trump called the “largest AI infrastructure project in history.”.
The companies will invest $100 billion in the project to start, with plans to pour up to $500 billion into Stargate in the coming years.
The project is expected to create 100,000 US jobs, Trump said.
Stargate will build “the physical and virtual infrastructure to power the next generation of AI,” including data centers around the country, Trump said.
Ellison said the group's first, 1 million-square foot data project is already under construction in Texas.
AI leaders have for months been sounding the alarm that more data centers — as well as the chips and electricity and water resources to run them — are needed to power their artificial intelligence ambitions in the coming years.
“I think this will be the most important project of this era,” Altman said on Tuesday.
“We wouldn't be able to do this without you, Mr. President.”.
Oracle is among the biggest US data center operators.
And SoftBank has the kind of deep pockets needed to fund the expansion of AI infrastructure, which is expected to cost billions of dollars.
Altman has previously urged US officials to aid in that infrastructure buildout to ensure the United States remains ahead of China in the AI arms race, given that AI is poised to impact everything from the economy to military capabilities.
The OpenAI CEO also r eportedly met with Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son last year to solicit investment in new semiconductor plants for building AI chips.
Altman, who attended Trump's inauguration Monday, told Fox News last month that he believes Trump will “be very good at” attracting AI infrastructure investments to the United States and said he looks “forward to working with his administration on it.” .
“Infrastructure in the United States is super important, AI is a little bit different from other kinds of software in that it requires massive amounts of infrastructure, power, computer chips, data centers, and we need to build that here and we need to be able to have the best AI infrastructure in the world to be able to lead with the technology and the capabilities,” Altman said in the interview.
In a policy white paper published last week, OpenAI said investment in US AI infrastructure can ensure that US AI tools win out over Chinese technology, as well as creating new US jobs and economic opportunities, and urged the US government to create “foundational strategy to ensure that investment in infrastructure benefits the most people possible and maximizes access to AI.”
The brief estimated that there are “$175 billion sitting in global funds awaiting investment in AI projects.”.
“If the US doesnt attract those funds, they will flow to China-backed projects—strengthening the Chinese Communist Partys global influence,” the company said.
Oracle said in a statement that the Stargate project “will secure American leadership in AI, create hundreds of thousands of American jobs, and generate massive economic benefit for the entire world.
This project will not only support the re-industrialization of the United States but also provide a strategic capability to protect the national security of America and its allies.”.
SoftBank will have financial responsibility for Stargate and OpenAI will have operational responsibility.
A fourth partner, MGX, is also contributing funding.
SoftBank's Son will be Stargate's chairman, OpenAI said .
New presidents and presidents-elect have often held joint announcements with companies about massive US investments to promote a supposed rebirth of American industry.
But their track record for success is decidedly mixed.
Trump in 2017 announced with Foxconn a massive $10 billion electronics factory in Wisconsin that was expected to create 13,000 jobs.
But the company eventually abandoned most of its plans for the facility and the high-tech products it was set to build.
The company in 2021 said it would invest just $672 million in a revised deal that would create fewer than 1,500 jobs.
Foxconn has said it invested $1 billion into the state, however, and it still has a major manufacturing site for data servers with more than 1,000 employees.
But the facility Trump announced has become a Microsoft data hub that aims to train employees and manufacturers on how to best use artificial intelligence.
Trump on Monday also reversed an executive order passed by former President Joe Biden in 2023 that aimed to monitor and regulate AI risks.

# Barbie Hsu, Taiwanese actress known as 'Big S,' dies of flu-related illness at age 48 | CNN.
Hong Kong CNN — .
Taiwanese actor Barbie Hsu, one of the most prominent stars in the Chinese-speaking world, has died of a flu-related illness at age 48, Taiwan's official Central News Agency reported Monday, citing her sister.
Hsu died of pneumonia after catching the flu during a family holiday in Japan, her younger sister Dee Hsu said in a statement shared by her agent, CNA reported.
“I am grateful that I could be her sister in this life, to take care and accompany each other,” Dee Hsu said.
“I will always be grateful to her and miss her.”.
The star had faced poor health in recent years, her sister previously said on television.
Widely known as “Big S,” Hsu rose to fame at age 17 in the mid-1990s alongside her younger sister in Mandapop duo S.O.S. The siblings were known for their sharp sense of humor, underscored when both became popular talk show hosts.
But it was Hsu's lead role in the iconic 2001 television drama “Meteor Garden” that catapulted her to fame across the region as her portrayal of an ordinary girl who finds love with a rich boy resonated with millions of fans.
On Monday, “Big S passed away” became the top trending topic on China's Weibo social media platform, amassing over 1.5 billion views, as shocked fans mourned the star.
“This is really hard to believe,” a top comment with more than 54,000 likes said.
“It was so sudden, life is too short,” said another.
Many Chinese celebrities also expressed shock over Hsu's death.
“What a bolt from the blue,” her “Meteor Garden” co-star Ken Chu wrote on Weibo.
Hsu retired from the entertainment industry in 2022 following the end of her 11-year marriage to Chinese businessman Wang Xiaofei, a hot topic on social media on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.
She is survived by her husband, Korean rapper Koo Jun-yup, and two children from her previous marriage.

Title: Do you still need to pay for your home if it was destroyed by a disaster?
| CNN Business
# Do you still need to pay for your home if it was destroyed by a disaster?
| CNN Business.
CNN — .
Wildfires, raging floods, tornadoes and hurricanes can obliterate your home, but not your mortgage.
The hard reality is that even when you live in a federally declared disaster area — like those ravaged by wildfires in Los Angeles County or battered by hurricanes in North Carolina and other states — you still will owe the bank whatever is left on your loan, even though your house no longer exists or is uninhabitable.
There are, however, some disaster-related relief programs that can temporarily reduce or suspend your mortgage payment for up to a year and sometimes beyond, depending on your circumstance.
Here's what you need to know.
The servicer is listed on your mortgage statement and is the first place you should call to learn about your options, which typically involve a form of forbearance.
The types of mortgage relief a servicer can provide will be governed in part by the entity that backs your mortgage or holds it in its portfolio.
Usually that's an individual bank or a government agency (e.g., Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac, the Federal Housing Administration, the Veterans' Administration, etc.) If you're not sure which it is, your servicer can tell you.
Specific eligibility rules to qualify for forbearance may differ depending on which entity holds or backs your loan, but even if you were delinquent on your loan prior to the disaster, you still may be granted forbearance.
In the case of Fannie Mae, for instance, servicers are expected to offer relief to borrowers in cases of financial hardship, even if they'd been delinquent prior to the disaster, said Jenise Hight, vice president of the agency's single-family credit risk policy.
Typically, with a federally backed loan, you're likely to be offered forbearance of between three to 12 months, during which your mortgage payments will be suspended or reduced.
During the forbearance period, you should not be subject to late fees or legal proceedings like foreclosure.
(For those affected by the Los Angeles area wildfires, California Gov.
Gavin Newsom announced on January 18 that five big banks — Bank of America, Citi, JPMorgan Chase, US Bank and Wells Fargo — will automatically offer a 90-day moratorium on mortgages that will not preclude further relief.
They will also offer at least 60 days protection from new foreclosures or evictions.) .
If you don't call your servicer right away: Check the rules of the entity backing your loan, but Fannie Mae also expects servicers of the loans it backs to automatically offer forbearance for 90 days if they haven't heard from a borrower but know the person's home is in a presidentially declared major disaster area.
During that 90-day period, though, such borrowers should make it a top priority to call their servicer to explain their situation and work out a longer forbearance arrangement.
“It's very important that the borrower reaches out and stays in constant contact with the servicer,” Hight said.
You will still owe the money for the months your payments were suspended or reduced.
But you won't necessarily have to pay back those arrearages as a lump sum when your forbearance expires.
You may be able to work out a new arrangement with your servicer to spread out those back payments over a longer period of time.
“It all depends on a borrower's facts and circumstances,” Hight said.
For example, she explained, if you have a job and you can make your regular mortgage payments but just need more time to pay off the arrearages, you may be able to work out a new deferral plan or spread out the amount you owe from the forbearance period over a certain number of months on top of your regular payments.
Or, if you're still struggling financially and can't even manage to make your normal payments after forbearance, you might work out a loan modification with the servicer, which would potentially lower your monthly payments going forward, extend the term of the loan and spread out the arrearages owed over the new life of the loan.
Rules governing mortgage relief for loans backed by Freddie Mac are similar.
And that agency notes that even if your home survives after a disaster but your job doesn't, you may still be able to get forbearance.
When your physical and financial life get turned upside down by an external disaster, it can be hard to think straight.
So if you need help dealing with your mortgage and other disaster-related financial issues, you can find free, experienced assistance.
Individual lenders and mortgage backers may offer you the services of free housing counselors.
And the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and other disaster relief organizations may direct you to trusted partners in the arena.
One such group is Operation HOPE , which works out of the recovery centers set up by FEMA and the American Red Cross .
It also offers services online and via mobile app.
The person assisting you can act as an approved third-party representative to negotiate a mortgage forbearance arrangement with your servicer and help you fill out any necessary applications and get copies of destroyed documents.
In previous disasters where the group has worked, including Hurricane Helene and the Maui fires, Operation HOPE has found that lenders usually render a decision within 48 to 72 hours on forbearance, said Lance Triggs, president of program operations for the organization.
That timeline squares with a statement sent to CNN from Chase Home Lending, for instance: “Once a customer requests disaster forbearance, requests are reviewed within 2 business days and the protections are set up immediately.”.
Operation HOPE can also help you negotiate with other creditors and assist you with the complexities of securing insurance money.
“Historically, we find that at least 40% of people [we've worked with after a disaster are] underinsured or not insured,” Triggs said.
If your homeowners' insurance policy was dropped or lapsed just before the disaster, Operation HOPE may get on the phone with your old insurer to see if they can reinstate it retroactively or connect you with other resources to try help fill the gap.

Title: Federal employees confused, angered by Trump's offer to quit | CNN Politics
# Federal employees confused, angered by Trump's offer to quit | CNN Politics.
CNN — .
President Donald Trump's offer to most federal employees to resign now and be paid through September stunned the workers who received it - angering some, confusing many and raising questions about whether the offer is even legal.
When a US Department of Agriculture staffer based in Mississippi received the deferred resignation offer on Tuesday, they read through it, laughing because it was just “nonsensical,” and then deleted it.
“I've got my whole entire life invested in the federal government,” said the staffer, who also spent time in the military.
“I'm not going to throw everything away.”.
Across the United States, multiple federal workers who spoke with CNN said they weren't willing to sacrifice benefits beyond their salaries - including health and retirement benefits and student loan forgiveness - not to mention careers.
They requested their names not be used for fear of retaliation.
Federal workers' unions quickly lashed out at the deferred resignation offer, stressing that it was not a buyout and that the administration might not be able to follow through on it.
“Employees should not take the Program at face value,” the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal workforce union, told members about the offer in an FAQ on Wednesday.
The communications from the Office of Personnel Management are “riddled with inconsistencies and uncertainties.
It is also unclear whether OPM has the legal authority to support the Program or its alleged benefits, and the eligibility criteria are vague.” .
The union warned that the offer contains no guarantees that employees whose resignations are accepted “will receive the benefits that the Program purports to offer.”
And it noted that the federal government is only funded through mid-March, so the Trump administration cannot make payment promises beyond then until Congress passes a spending bill.
The backlash prompted the Trump administration to send another email to employees on Friday, this time coming from their individual agencies.
It reinforced, in underlined text, that the offer is “valid, lawful, and will be honored by” the respective departments.
Also, those who accept the offer will “not be subject to a reduction-in-force or other premature separation,” will not be expected to work during the roughly eight-month period (with rare exceptions) and can take a non-governmental job during that time.
Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller said, without evidence, that “a significant number of federal workers have accepted the buyout offer” during a gaggle with reporters at the White House Friday.
But workers CNN interviewed are not jumping at the chance to jump ship.
The Mississippi USDA employee, who said accepting the offer is out of the question, was most offended that the OPM email referenced that federal employees should be “loyal.”.
“When I raised my right hand way back a long time ago, I swore to defend the Constitution,” they told CNN.
“So I'm not loyal to anybody.
I'm loyal to my country.”.
The OPM email, which contained the subject line “Fork in the Road,” had many similarities to an email that X, then called Twitter, sent to its employees days after Elon Musk took over the company.
Musk now leads Trump's Department of Government Efficiency , which has been tasked with shrinking the federal workforce as one of its mandates.
The offer came as Trump seeks to reshape the federal workforce - including reducing its size, replacing career workers with political appointees, wiping away some civil service protections , ending diversity efforts and more.
Some 2.4 million people work for the federal government, not including postal workers, who are not eligible for the package.
Also excluded are military personnel and those in positions related to immigration enforcement and national security, among others.
Those who qualify have to decide by February 6.
A US Department of Agriculture employee, who is nearing retirement, said they won't take Trump up on the incentive and don't expect anyone else in their field office in Illinois to, either.
“They're trying to change everything overnight,” said the employee.
“They're trying to reinvent the government, and I don't think they can do it.”.
“I retire by 60.
I have my 25 years.
I'm vested.
I'm not going anywhere,” they continued.
Trump's administration is also seeking to crack down on federal employees working from home or in hybrid roles , rather than in their offices full-time.
But much of the federal workforce is located outside the nation's capital, and Trump's offer was met with confusion and skepticism in many of those offices.
While some workers said it was unclear from the original email if they'd have to continue working through September, an FAQ on the OPM site said that employees would not be expected to work and were encouraged to find private sector jobs.
“You are most welcome (to) stay at home and relax or to travel to your dream destination.
Whatever you would like,” the FAQ read.
Others didn't like the ominous warning in the OPM email that if they opt to stay, “we cannot give you full assurance regarding the certainty of your position or agency.”
They also bristled at the OPM FAQ that encourages workers to move from “lower productivity jobs in the public sector to higher productivity jobs in the private sector” to boost American prosperity.
A Labor Department employee told CNN they initially considered the offer, but said, “as time passes, more skepticism grows,” in part because of their doubts that the Trump administration will follow through on the eight months of pay it offered.
One Department of Veterans Affairs worker said the Trump administration's offer had backfired.
“Before today, I heard nothing except folks wanting to leave,” the worker said a day after receiving the offer.
“Today folks are determined to stay.”.
The initial offer to quit raised eyebrows among some who said the emails they've received lately from the OPM did not look legitimate.
Some thought the initial test emails OPM sent last week were phishing scams, prompting them to ask their managers what to do.
Some federal workers said Trump's changes will uproot their lives - and said the offer diminishes the value of work they believe helps Americans.
One Internal Revenue Service worker told CNN that the offer angered them, although a few of their colleagues have expressed interest in it.
“Do they think we're stupid enough to do it?” said the staffer, who intends to stay with the federal government until retirement, which is still years away.
“They are going to have to fire me.”.
The worker, who lives in the South with their spouse and young child, said they find it fulfilling to help people.
“I really do love it, especially when I'm on the phone with someone getting their problems sorted out and [the taxpayer is] having money coming their way that they've been desperately trying to get ahold of on their own,” the IRS staffer said.
Some workers found the OPM email disturbing.
One Department of Interior employee - who said their division is already understaffed and has had to hire contractors, who are paid more - couldn't sleep on Tuesday night after receiving the deferred resignation package.
“It's intimidation.
It's harassment,” said the worker, who lives in Oklahoma. “
It's questioning all the hard work and importance of what we do.
Being treated like this is not humane, and it's not professional.”.
The OPM email was written in a manner designed to coerce federal employees to resign, Doreen Greenwald, national president of the National Treasury Employees Union, told CNN in an interview.
“It was written in a very negative tone, in a threatening manner,” she said.
“It provided no clarity on what was being offered.”.
After OPM announced the offer, the union sent an urgent notice to members “strongly” urging them not to resign.
The NTEU wanted to reassure employees that they had a choice, Greenwald said.
“There were no answers provided in that document, and so we had to provide that information to our members to protect them,” she told CNN.
Plus, having a mass exodus of federal employees “would be catastrophic to the federal government and the services that Americans depend on every day,” Greenwald said.
Other federal employee unions had similar messages for their members, all questioning the legality of the offer.
“Unlike structured programs that the federal government offered in the past to decrease the number of federal employees, this maneuver is intended to panic civil servants into accepting what seems like a sweet deal but is probably a scam,” Randy Erwin, national president of the National Federation of Federal Employees, said in a statement Wednesday.
“The offer is a scare tactic designed to pressure federal workers into quitting while promising under an illegal and unenforceable agreement to pay them until October.”.

CNN — .
This Super Bowl Sunday, keep an eye out for bad calls, fouls and dangerous sodium levels.
Foods advertised in National Football League commercials contain an average of nearly 40% of the daily recommended sodium intake, according to a new study.
“We proved what probably a lot of people have long suspected, and that is that foods advertised during NFL games … are frequently high in sodium and calories and fat content,” said senior study author Dr. Paul Hauptman, dean of the University of Nevada, Reno's School of Medicine and chief academic officer for Renown Health.
Researchers recorded 10 NFL games between September 2023 and November 2023 and analyzed the number and duration of commercials advertising food products.
The team then looked at the nutritional information of those foods.
About 10% of the content, or 102 commercials, were advertising food, according to the study published Thursday in the journal JAMA Network Open .
The sodium content of those foods ranged from 220 milligrams to 1,872 milligrams, with a median amount of 910 milligrams, the study showed.
The Dietary Guidelines for Americans﻿ recommends people consume less than 2,300 milligrams per day. .
Fast-food restaurants advertised the products with the highest amount of sodium, the researchers found.
Eating too much salt can have many negative effects on your health.
High levels of sodium in a diet can lead to worsening of heart failure and hypertension, or high blood pressure, Hauptman said.
“Blood pressure is directly related to stroke, cardiovascular disease -- even to death from cardiovascular disease and heart failure,” said hypertension specialist Dr. Stephen Juraschek, an associate professor of medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School in Boston.
He was not involved in the research.
“Hypertension affects nearly half the US population, 1.5 billion adults worldwide , and is growing,” he added.
“This is a tremendous problem.” .
Salt isn't the only problematic ingredient in a lot of the foods advertised on television.
The fat and calorie contents are often high as well, which can have an especially negative impact on people with diabetes, Hauptman said.
Many aspects of watching a football game can impact the way you eat.
It's a sedentary activity, people often serve special foods to share, and the commercials make unhealthy foods look exciting to eat, Juraschek said.
“Advertising in general is intended to encourage certain types of behaviors, and when you look at products when they're being advertised, they're usually showing people smiling in kind of memorable, exciting occasions, maybe with loved ones or friends,” he added.
Many of the elements that go into how you make your food choices are emotional, Juraschek said.
Maybe you celebrate certain occasions with a particular food, or a certain dish is associated with spending time with people you love.
Advertisements may be trying to send you the message that partaking in the food they are trying to sell you will contribute to feeling close to your loved ones or having a good time, he added.
“And if those items are high in sodium and are highly processed … folks will be directed towards consuming more of those products, which is really concerning,” Juraschek said.
Because food choices are so often tied to traditions and memories and it can be so hard to adjust, Juraschek recommends being careful about what you are feeding children.
“It's so important early on that we don't overexpose young children to high sodium,” Juraschek said.
“Getting them hooked at a young age can contribute to a lifetime of chronic disease and disability.”.
Eating a healthy diet isn't always easy.
One essential step is to recognize where the sodium in your diet is coming from, Juraschek said.
Many patients say they don't add salt in their cooking, but it's also important to look at the processed foods you eat -- such as breads and deli meats -- which can have a surprising amount of sodium.
“Whenever you get away from the produce and kind of the fresh meat sections of the store and get to the middle, you'd be like, 'Wow, there's so many different products here, but almost every single one, universally, has a large amount of sodium,'” Juraschek added.
Going to a restaurant also can result in higher sodium consumption than home-cooked food, he said.
Next, try to make simple switches to lower-sodium options, Juraschek said.
Not all chips, dressings or dips have the same sodium content.
“We grow up with certain traditions, exposures -- we have memories around those food items,” he added.
“That's one way that we can still kind of enjoy that product, but maybe with less exposure.”.
And you might find that, over time, you don't miss the salt so much.
“Patients who are able to adhere to a low-sodium diet, not only are their symptoms better if they have heart failure, but their palate sort of adjusts,” Hauptman said.
Then, when patients are given foods high in sodium, they can taste it -- and they don't often like it, he added.
“Eat in moderation, and just try to read labels,” Hauptman said.

Title: Trump's race to honor his promises is bringing risk and turmoil to America and the world | CNN Politics
# Trump's race to honor his promises is bringing risk and turmoil to America and the world | CNN Politics.
CNN — .
President Donald Trump is doing exactly what he said he'd do.
He's launching hard-power trade wars to please voters marginalized by the globalized economy.
He's acting on despair over fentanyl's murderous toll.
He's launched a migrant crackdown amid anxiety over a porous southern border.
And the president, with the help of Elon Musk , is starting to gut the government that his supporters blame for their problems.
“When a president is elected by the People and then does what he promised to do, that's democracy,” Vice President JD Vance wrote on X on Saturday night.
“When a president is thwarted by unelected bureaucrats, that's oligarchy.
President Trump refuses to bend the knee to that oligarchy.
Buckle up!”.
Yet Trump's frantic push to honor campaign promises by a plurality of voters may come with a price.
Abroad, it threatens to compromise traditional American leadership and obligations the country has long set for itself, which are vital to the functioning of the global economy.
International agreements and undertakings made to allies are also in peril — like the North American trade deal Trump trampled with huge new tariffs on Canada and Mexico and the treaty under which the US handed over control of the Panama Canal .
And at home, a quickening purge of federal government workers and erratic spending decisions have already called into question assistance that's critical to the well-being of millions of citizens, as well as the legality of ousting scores of federal workers to fulfill Trump's political whims.
As Trump's second presidency enters its third week, there are growing questions over whether his radical disruption — which often flouts generations of US policy and even challenges the law — will fix any of the problems he was elected to solve.
Could it instead cleave deeper national divides, create economic chaos and pain for consumers — who elected him, in part, to lower prices — spike job losses, and leave America isolated after alienating its best friends in the world and destroying the international order?.
Trump won't hear of such talk.
You can argue with his grasp of economics.
But he's promising a complete overhaul of the global, free trade economy and a rebuilding of the US manufacturing base — even if it throws American allies into economic crises.
The days of a rising tide lifting all boats are over.
“MAKE YOUR PRODUCT IN THE USA AND THERE ARE NO TARIFFS!” the president wrote on Truth Social on Sunday.
“Why should the United States lose TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN SUBSIDIZING OTHER COUNTRIES.”.
Trump announced 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico and 10% levies on Chinese imports that are due to come into force at 12:01 a.m. ET on Tuesday.
The president said Sunday evening that he plans to speak to leaders in Canada and Mexico on Monday, though gave no sign he'd change his mind.
“I don't expect anything very dramatic.
We put tariffs on.
They owe us a lot of money, and I'm sure they're going to pay,” Trump told reporters as he stepped off Air Force One.
His faith in tariffs — a familiar device that helped speed the descent into the 1930s Great Depression — represents a huge gamble.
“This is a self-inflicted wound to the American economy,” former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said on CNN's “Inside Politics Sunday.”
Summers, who served under Democratic President Bill Clinton, added: “I'd expect inflation over the next three or four months to be higher as a consequence, because the price level has to go up when you put a levy on goods that people are buying.”.
Dismantling government can also be dangerous.
A temporary spending freeze, hurriedly withdrawn by the White House last week , hinted at mayhem that could ensue if federal services on which millions depend go away.
Trump's biggest moves so far reflect some of his lifelong obsessions, including a tendency to exert power over weaker adversaries.
His supporters insist it works — citing Colombia's retreat last week, in a showdown over migrant deportations, under the threat of economy-destroying US tariffs.
They also credit Trump's warning that “all hell will break lose” in the Middle East for recent the hostage releases by Hamas in Gaza.
But Trump's extraordinary steps to transform US domestic and foreign policy at lightning pace also pose political and economic risks.
His wielding of vast executive power could come across as an overreach that ignores voters' most pressing concerns.
And he risks driving US allies into the arms of adversaries like China.
It all amounts to a stunning blitz of economic, diplomatic and domestic power, happening by design at a fearsome pace, often without public transparency, that is almost impossible for citizens to process.
## Trump's power moves are shaking North America and the rest of the world .
* The president this weekend announced 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico and imposed 10% tariffs on Chinese exports to the United States.
He's also renewing his demand that Canada become the 51st state.
Trump has been coercing Denmark to hand over Greenland and Panama to give up control over its canal.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned Panama's president Sunday that Washington would take “measures necessary to protect its rights” under the Panama Canal Treaty because Hong Kong-based firms own two ports near either end of the key waterway.
Trump later warned: “We're going to take it back, or something very powerful is going to happen.” .
* Trump has also frozen US foreign aid , which has been maintained for decades on the principle that fighting starvation, poverty and illness fosters global stability that makes Americans safer.
Nongovernmental organizations are struggling to work out which services qualify for a State Department humanitarian waiver .
The US Agency for International Development's website just went dark .
And Musk declared over the weekend on X that the agency responsible for saving millions of lives is “a criminal organization.”
He added: “Time for it to die.” CNN reported on Sunday that top security officials at USAID were put on administrative leave after attempting to refuse access to agency systems to Musk's Department of Government Efficiency officials.
* At home, as it cranks up the pace of mass deportations, the administration Sunday revoked protection for 300,000 Venezuelans, leaving them vulnerable to being deported to their repressive, impoverished homeland.
* Trump's teams have accelerated a purge among law enforcement officials, firing more than a dozen prosecutors who worked on January 6, 2021, cases and demanding names of FBI agents ordered to work on Trump cases — a move that could potentially put the careers and livelihoods of thousands in peril.
* Musk, the tech pioneer who has billions of dollars in contracts and potential conflicts of interest with the US government,
stoked more disruption.
His DOGE team has accessed the federal payments system, potentially allowing him to monitor and limit government spending, after the top civil servant at the Treasury Department — who had pushed back on questions about stopping certain payments — left unexpectedly last week .
Trump's new trade wars encapsulate his unrestrained use of power and show how his beliefs contradict decades of conventional US global leadership.
The massive tariffs he plans to impose on Canada and Mexico on Tuesday can be traced back to his long-held belief that America is being ripped off by almost every other nation.
The tariffs' ostensible purpose is to punish American allies for failing to do more to crack down on undocumented migration and fentanyl reaching the United States.
Many Trump supporters see the president's love for “beautiful” tariffs as leverage to force concessions from other countries and to allow him to deliver “wins,” which often seem less meaty than he claims.
But this time, the imposition of tariffs is being billed as a victory in itself.
“These are promises made and promises kept by the president,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Friday.
But the win will come at a cost.
Canada said Saturday it would impose retaliatory tariffs on more than $100 billion in American imports.
Several top provincial politicians, meanwhile, urged Canadians to start boycotts of US products, including wine and liquor.
Mexico is vowing to unveil its own response Monday.
President Claudia Sheinbaum warned Sunday that talks, and not confrontation, are the best ways to solve problems.
She said: “Sovereignty is not negotiable.”.
While tensions have long boiled between the US and Mexico over border issues, problems at the northern border seem negligible.
According to US Customs and Border Protection statistics, only 43 pounds of fentanyl were seized at the northern border last year, compared with more than 21,000 pounds captured at the southwest border.
And Canada has already pledged to spend $1 billion on an enhanced border patrol operation.
This begs the question of whether America's No. 1 foreign priority is really addressing a threat from Canada, with which the US enjoys its most comprehensive trading partnership.
Trump's turn against Canada — which effectively trashes the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement that he signed in his first term and declared a great victory — risks pitching the economy of a trusted ally into a deep recession and costing hundreds of thousands of Canadian workers.
And while Mexico and Canada are in a vulnerable position because of their smaller economies, they can still hurt the US.
Their retaliatory tariffs could raise prices on key goods — even as Trump vows to lower grocery costs for US shoppers.
Trump's tariff attacks on Mexico and Canada also reverse a decadeslong project to integrate the US and Canadian economies — part of a broader US foreign policy goal of building a rules-based global order of free nations meant to promote prosperity and democracy.
In Canada's case, this has meant coming to America's defense, in its greatest hours of need — including after the September 11 attacks in 2001.
“History has made us friends, economics has made us partners and necessity has made us allies,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Saturday.
“That rang true for many decades … from the beaches of Normandy to the mountains of the Korean Peninsula, from the fields of Flanders to the streets of Kandahar.”.
Trump, however, seeks far greater control over the Western Hemisphere — which, together with his love of tariffs, is creating a 19th century vibe.
“Canada should become our Cherished 51st State.
Much lower taxes, and far better military protection for the people of Canada — AND NO TARIFFS!
” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Sunday from Florida, where he twice visited one of his golf courses over the weekend.
But the president's threats are backfiring.
“It's an act of economic warfare.
And the president was clear just this morning that it is a direct attack on our sovereignty,” former Canadian Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland told CNN's Fareed Zakaria on Sunday.
Freeland, a candidate for the leadership of Canada's Liberal Party, and therefore to replace Trudeau as prime minister , added: “Americans are going to be astonished by the Canadian response.
We're hurt, for sure, because we're your friends and neighbors.
But most of all, we're angry, and we are united and resolute.” .
Still, Trump isn't hiding what he wants, and right now, he is wielding almost unaccountable power.
“We are led by someone who is not very mysterious.
He's going to tell you what he's going to do and he'll actually do it,” Rubio said on Sirius XM's “The Megyn Kelly Show” last week.
Or, as Vance put it: “Buckle up.”.

CNN — .
By the time he died, aged just 32, he had redrawn the map of the northern hemisphere, conquering land across three continents and ruling over states from Egypt to modern-day India — over 2,000 years ago.
Since his death in 323 BCE, the world has been obsessed with Alexander the Great, who set out from his kingdom of Macedon (in modern-day Greece) at the age of 20 to conquer the mighty Persian Empire.
He made it as far as the Indus River in modern-day Pakistan, and even crossed into today's India, before dying in Babylon in today's Iraq.
Over 2,000 years later, travelers can still see his legacy in countries as far afield as Egypt, Turkey and Pakistan — as well as Greece, of course, where, in 2024, archaeologists opened the Royal Palace of Aigai to visitors.
The palace was the ceremonial hub for the Macedonian dynasty, and Alexander was crowned here following the assassination of his father, Philip II.
There are dozens more sites around the globe where visitors can get close to the man — and the myth.
What Alexander achieved in his 32 years is “unique,” says Paul Cartledge, AG Leventis professor emeritus of Greek culture at the University of Cambridge, who adds that the Macedonian “redrew the map of the world” by force, where his father had always tried diplomacy first.
Crowned king of Macedon in 336 BCE at the age of 20, Alexander spent just two years in Europe after Philip's assassination, shoring up his rule and putting down revolts in southern Greece and the Balkans.
Then, in 334 BCE, he led his army into Asia to fulfil Philip's ambition of conquering the Persian Empire — the largest in the world at that time.
Over a 10-year period, fighting across modern-day Turkey, the Middle East, and as far away as Afghanistan and Pakistan, Alexander routed Persian king Darius III, taking the empire for his own.
His territory now extended from the Adriatic Sea to the Indus River — and he was only 30.
From there, he pressed on into the Indian subcontinent and into modern-day Pakistan's Punjab province, where he made further conquests, pushing into modern-day India, before his weary army rebelled.
They turned back but on the way home, Alexander was struck by a two-week fever and died in Babylon.
His body was taken to Egypt and was said to have been entombed in Alexandria, where it was venerated by everyone from Cleopatra to Julius Caesar, before disappearing in around the fifth century.
It has never been found.
Alexander died without having ever lost a battle, and while his empire soon splintered, for centuries, the official language of administration in the area remained Greek.
“That's why Greek spread all over the Middle East, and why the New Testament is written in Greek,” says Cartledge.
While he was hated by many Athenians, who believed in democracy not monarchies or empires — and while, Cartledge says, some followers of Zoroastrianism, an ancient monotheistic religion, still think of him as evil for destroying their ancient records in Persepolis, modern-day Iran — since his death Alexander has achieved an almost god-like status.
For Cartledge, Alexander was unique.
“It takes an exceptional personality to preside over what he did,” he says, citing Genghis Khan as one of the few leaders of his caliber.

Alexander's legacy is no stuffy history lesson.
In fact, the story of the young man from Macedonia who pushed to the boundaries of the world has had fans from the word go.
In the Roman period, writers including Arrian and Plutarch composed biographies of Alexander.
Next, the “Alexander Romance” — first written in third-century Alexandria in Egypt — became hugely popular.
Essentially a novel based on his life, it was translated into languages including Arabic and Persian — “every language in the world,” according to Pierre Briant, professor emeritus at the Collège de France, “The Achaemenid empire and Alexander's empire” chair.
In 1010 CE, Persian poet Firdawsi wrote “Shahnamah,” the “Book of Kings,” which portrayed Alexander as Sikander, a Persian, and half-brother to Dara, or Darius.
In this, Alexander preserves Persia's Zoroastrian religion.
Briant says the book went “everywhere in the Middle and Far East” — even to Indonesia.
Today, cities from Alexandria in Egypt to Kandahar in Afghanistan are named for Alexander.
##### Alexander's 'great' legacy around the world .

“I think it's a combination of his age — he did so much before he died — and the extraordinary distance that he traveled,” says Cartledge.
“He got as far as modern-day Afghanistan, Pakistan, a bit of India.
He didn't always go through very nicely, but he triumphed over ever possible obstacle: a mountain, a river, war elephants, scythed chariots.
Everything that was thrown at him, he overcame.”.
Even today, people are catching the Alexander bug.
“When I was a teenager I hated history,” says Peter Sommer, a UK tour operator who owes his career to Alexander.
At school, Sommer planned to specialize in sciences, but one day his history teacher showed pupils a map of Alexander's travels.
“My jaw fell open, hit the desk, and I went home and said, 'I want to study ancient history,'” he says.
He changed his courses and went on to study ancient history and archaeology at university, writing his undergraduate thesis and masters dissertation on Alexander-related topics.
He also embarked on a four-and-a-half-month, 2,000-mile hike through modern-day Turkey, recreating Alexander's progress from the ancient city of Troy to the location of the Battle of Issus in modern-day Anatolia, where he first beat Darius.
“I thought, 'How can I understand Alexander if I haven't been to the places?'” he says.
“I'd never traveled before, but I fell in love with travel and with Turkey.”.
Having completed a similar project for the BBC, he launched his own tour company, Peter Sommer Travels , taking small groups on cultural, archaeological and food itineraries.
Sommer has run Alexander-themed tours across Turkey and Greece, and says his clients on those tours are “totally mixed.”
While you might imagine that tours following in the steps of a great warrior might be male-focused, Sommer says that “we have lots of female travelers who are completely nuts about Alexander.”.
Perhaps that's because of his rather 21st-century approach to women.
Unlike ancient conquerors who took rape and pillage as their right in victory, Alexander tended to stick to the latter and eschew the former.
In one memorable story, having defeated Darius (who fled) at the Battle of Issus, Alexander captured the Persian royals, including Darius' wife and mother.
Instead of enslaving them, as might have been expected, he treated them with dignity.
Sisygambis, Darius' mother, came to love Alexander as a second son, and even died of grief after his death, the story goes.
What ancient figure could be more suited to a 21st-century audience than this unlikely respectful king?.
Sommer says his clients on the Alexander tours are “total Alexander enthusiasts… they wanted to talk about him at every lunch, every dinner.”.
He puts it down to Alexander's “charisma” that still shines through the centuries.
“What fascinated me is how someone could do all this by the age of 32,” he says.
“To have had the biggest military campaign ever.
To lead from the front, up to 100,000 troops.
His charisma must have been extraordinary.”.
For his clients, traveling in the footsteps of Alexander can be emotional.
One, who writes the Mega Alexandros blog but prefers to stay anonymous for privacy reasons, recalls an “unforgettable” drive through Iran's Zagros mountains when a sandstorm swept up from Mesapotamia, Iraq.
“The bus stopped and sand was in my face, pulling at my clothes,” they say.
“I thought, Alexander must have had such days.
They had to march through that.
'” In Uzbekistan, on an eight-hour bus ride from Tashkent to Bukhara, they thought, “My god, how did they do it?
I couldn't move at the pace his soldiers walked.
When you're on the spot and see the landscape, it's totally different.
You learn to look at the landscape because they had to.
For me there's nothing that can replace that.”.
Alexander has joined an elite group of usually mythical figures whose characters shapeshift along with society's beliefs and desires.
“The histories keep changing,” says Sommer.
“He gets written up completely differently according to the time.
He's like a renaissance man that people interpret for themselves.”.
Cartledge says “We project our dreams, fantasies and nightmares on people we call great.
They're by no means always good, but they achieve something way beyond what you or I possibly could.”.
But Cartledge also says Alexander was a great propagandist.
Two thousand years on, we still largely believe 'his' side of the story.
He even linked himself to Homer's mythical hero Achilles, adding romantic and homoerotic sides to his legacy.
Although he thinks Alexander's episodes of slaughter — especially towards the end of his campaign — are a “a real stain on his memory,” Cartledge says “I admire him intensely.
He was very brave, charismatic, had very great qualities, but also did some absolutely awful things.
He was unique.”.
One person who interprets Alexander a little differently from most is Briant.
An expert on both the Macedonian and the Achaemenid (Persian) empires, and author of A short introduction: Alexander the Great , Briant bristles at the idea that Alexander achieved something that had never been done before.
The clue, he says, is in what Alexander did: conquer the Persian Empire.
“You can't speak of Alexander alone as if he were a kind of supernatural person and without any context,” he says.
“If you speak of conquests, you have to speak about the Achaemenid Empire.
The Persian king had conquered Persia 200 years earlier, so when Alexander came to conquer the Middle East he had to conquer an organized empire.
He was not the first.”.
In fact, says Briant, there's a simple reason why, 2,000 years on, we talk about Alexander but not Cyrus the Great, who founded the Achaemenid Empire in 550 BCE: racism.
“We are Europe-focused,” he says of historians.
“Alexander has taken an enormous place in European thought from antiquity to the modern era.
He was considered the first conqueror of the east… a precedent for European conquerors.
Some 18th and 19th-century historians explained his victories as announcing the future victories of European armies against the Ottomans.
It has become a kind of European political myth, and very important for European thoughts about Asia and the Middle East.
” One of his books looks at the concept of Alexander as the “ First European .” .
Greek and Roman authors weren't interested in the Persian Empire, he says — meaning that even from antiquity, it was effectively erased from history.
“When I speak with colleagues, especially from the US, working on Alexander, I ask, 'Why are you not interested in the history of the Persian Empire?' Some respond, “It's too difficult, it's another world.
' In fact it's the same world,” he says.
He calls Oliver Stone's 2004 film, “Alexander,” starring Colin Farrell, “completely foolish” for its lack of Persian context.
Briant even rubbishes the idea of the Hellenization of the east that took place after Alexander — when Greek became the official language.
“This didn't mean the local culture disappeared — quite the contrary,” he says, adding that everyone from the Egyptians to the Babylonians used their own language, too.
Instead, he calls it a “meeting of cultures:” something that Alexander — who appalled his troops by dressing in Persian robes, married a woman from what is now known as Afghanistan (Roxana), and buffered his army with Persian soldiers — would surely have approved of.
While today we see Alexander's behavior as multiculturalism, in reality it was political, says Briant.
“Alexander was fighting for 13 years —- his main concern was maintaining an army,” he says.
“By the end the army was mainly Iranian, and maybe he was concerned about culture, but the main point was to maintain military forces.”
The same goes for his marriage to Roxana, which Briant calls “political,” About Alexander's legendary treatment of Sisygambis, Cartledge agrees Alexander “wanted [the Persian royals] to buy into the new order.”.
Although Briant acknowledges Alexander's brilliance on the battlefield, his courage and intelligence, he emphasizes that the Macedonian wasn't conquering brand-new territory, mile by mile, but a pre-existing empire.
“He conquered the Persian empire and its frontiers — it was his main goal,” says Briant.
“That's why it's important to know about the Persian Empire.
You can't understand Alexander if you don't understand Darius, the last king of the Persian Empire.”.
Not for nothing is one of his books “ Darius in the shadow of Alexander .” .
Rather than Alexander or even Darius III, Briant says the man we should be venerating is Darius I, “the main conqueror and organizer of the empire.”
Thousands of clay tablets found in Persepolis, in modern-day Iran, are finally being translated — and they show his importance, he says.
Cartledge — author of “Alexander the Great” — agrees that Darius I was a formidable ruler, who tolerated other religions.
“But I'd say as a Greek historian that the impact of Alexander taking over what Darius had created made [the empire] even more amazing,” he says.
“He transmitted a Greco-Persian culture.
Darius was an amazing figure but I'd say Alexander's achievement was even greater.” .
Visitors to modern-day Iran can see remains of the empire at Persepolis, Susa and Pasargadae, the first capital of the Achaemenid Empire.
While in northern Greece you'll find Pella, the ruined city where Alexander was born, as well as the tomb of Philip and other Macedonian royals in a spectacular underground museum at Vergina (ancient Aigai), and the newly opened royal palace above.
A little further south, at the foot of Mount Olympus (the most sacred site in Ancient Greece) is Dion, where Alexander made sacrifices to the god Zeus before setting out for Persia.
And east of Aigai, past Thessaloniki (which was named for Alexander's half-sister) is Philippi, renamed by Philip after he conquered it.
There, an inscription in the museum bears a missive from Alexander ruling on a boundary dispute.
In Turkey, Sommer recommends the Istanbul Archaeology Museums, where there are two statues of Alexander as well as the Alexander Sarcophagus , a fourth-century BCE sarcophagus found in Lebanon, intricately carved with scenes from the life of the king.
Myths and as yet unproven theories also link him to other sites across the northern hemisphere.
The ancient Thracian city of Perperikon, perched on a hilltop, in Bulgaria is said to be the legendary Oracle of Dionysus, where Alexander is said to have been told he would conquer the world, before setting out for Persia.
And some even believe that his bones were stolen from Alexandria by Venetians, who mistook them for the relics of St. Mark, which they ransacked from the Egyptian city and took home.
Could they be the remains guarded closely in St. Mark's Basilica in Venice?.
Nobody knows what Alexander was planning when he died, though it's thought he was eying the Persian Gulf and more of northern Africa.
But his legend has lived on.
And despite his flaws, perhaps we could all be a little bit more Alexander.
“He didn't spare himself.
He didn't play the long game.
He tried to achieve as much as he could in the shortest possible time, possibly realizing he was going to die early,” says Cartledge.
For his fans, he is an inspiration across the centuries.
“Alexander was a driven person,” says the Mega Alexandros blogger.
“He went off to his end of the rainbow — and he never doubted he would reach it.”.

Title: Trump shrugs off Elon Musk's criticism of AI announcement: 'He hates one of the people' | CNN Business
# Trump shrugs off Elon Musk's criticism of AI announcement: 'He hates one of the people' | CNN Business.
CNN — .
President Donald Trump on Thursday shrugged off an ugly back-and-forth between tech CEOs Elon Musk and Sam Altman that pitted one of Trump's most visible lieutenants against a key participant in a massive $500 billion AI project Trump announced Tuesday.
Musk had undercut Trump's Tuesday Oval Office AI announcement, casting doubt on his X social media platform that any of the participating companies had the money to fund it.
But Trump Thursday told reporters at the White House that Musk's commentary was just a case of bad blood, because he “hates one of the people in the deal” - not an indictment of the viability of the deal he had announced.
“No, he hates one of the people,” Trump said, in an apparent reference to Altman.
“I've spoken to Elon, but—spoken to all of them, actually.
The people in the deal are very, very smart people- but Elon, one of the people he happens to hate.
But I have certain hatreds of people too.”.
Shortly after Trump announced the new massive AI infrastructure investment between Altman's OpenAI, Oracle and Softbank, Musk wrote on his social media platform X, “They don't actually have the money.
SoftBank has well under $10B secured.
I have that on good authority.”.
Pressed on Musk's comments Thursday, Trump told reporters, “I don't know if they do, but you know, they're putting up the money- the government's not putting up anything, they're putting up money.
They're very rich people, so I hope they do.”.
Trump had announced the investment will create a new company, called Stargate, to grow artificial intelligence infrastructure in the United States.
The leaders of SoftBank, OpenAI and Oracle stood alongside Trump during the announcement.
Their respective companies will invest $100 billion in total for the project to start, with plans to pour up to $500 billion into Stargate in the coming years.
Following the post, Altman and Musk have traded barbs on the platform , with Musk, who's in an ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI, sharing former posts critical of Trump from Altman to his own X page.
Asked in a follow-up exchange if he was frustrated with Musk's very public criticism of the AI announcement he helped broker, Trump demurred Thursday.
Musk's barbs represented a notable takedown of a major White House project from someone that is in Trump's innermost circle.
As a sign of how involved Musk is in the first days of the administration, Musk said he was in the Oval Office on Tuesday as Trump signed a pardon for Ross William Ulbricht, founder of the dark web marketplace SilkRoad.
Musk had also dispatched a top staffer from his SpaceX and X companies to help ensure the release of convicted January 6 rioters after Trump signed a blanket pardon.
But perhaps it should not be a surprise that Musk is going after an OpenAI initiative.
Musk is in an ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman, who was at the White House for the announcement.
Musk, who has said he “doesn't trust” Altman, claims in the lawsuit the ChatGPT has abandoned its original nonprofit mission by reserving some of its most advanced AI technology for private customers.
The companies involved in Stargate have not publicly disclosed how they will contribute the funds, but they don't necessarily need the money in the bank to support it — they could raise debt or sign on other equity investors.
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Wednesday rebuffed Musk's comments, saying in a Fox News interview, “the American people should take President Trump and those CEOs' words for it.”.
CNN's Hadas Gold contributed to this report.

Title: Analysis: DeepSeek's AI is giving the world a window into Chinese censorship and information control | CNN
# Analysis: DeepSeek's AI is giving the world a window into Chinese censorship and information control | CNN.
Hong Kong CNN — .
Previously little-known Chinese startup DeepSeek has dominated headlines and app charts in recent days thanks to its new AI chatbot , which sparked a global tech sell-off that wiped billions off Silicon Valley's biggest companies and shattered assumptions of America's dominance of the tech race.
But those signing up for the chatbot and its open-source technology are being confronted with the Chinese Communist Party's brand of censorship and information control.
Ask DeepSeek's newest AI model, unveiled last week, to do things like explain who is winning the AI race, summarize the latest executive orders from the White House or tell a joke and a user will get similar answers to the ones spewed out by American-made rivals OpenAI's GPT-4, Meta's Llama or Google's Gemini.
Yet when questions veer into territory that would be restricted or heavily moderated on China's domestic internet, the responses reveal aspects of the country's tight information controls.
Using the internet in the world's second most populous country is to cross what's often dubbed the “Great Firewall” and enter a completely separate internet eco-system policed by armies of censors, where most major Western social media and search platforms are blocked.
The country routinely ranks among the most restrictive for internet and speech freedoms in reports from global watchdogs .
The international popularity of Chinese apps like TikTok and RedNote have already raised national security concerns among Western governments - as well as questions about the potential impact to free speech and Beijing's ability to shape global narratives and public opinion.
Now, the introduction of DeepSeek's AI assistant - which is free and rocketed to the top of app charts in recent days - raises the urgency of those questions, observers say, and spotlights the online ecosystem from which they have emerged.
One example of a question DeepSeek's new bot, using its R1 model, will answer differently than a Western rival?
The Tiananmen Square massacre on June 4, 1989, when the Chinese government brutally cracked down on student protesters in Beijing and across the country, killing hundreds if not thousands of students in the capital, according to estimates from rights groups.
Chinese authorities have so thoroughly suppressed discussion of the massacre in the decades since that many people in China grow up never having heard about it.
A search for 'what happened on June 4, 1989 in Beijing' on major Chinese online search platform Baidu turns up articles noting that June 4 is the 155th day in the Gregorian calendar or a link to a state media article noting authorities that year “quelled counter-revolutionary riots” - with no mention of Tiananmen.
When the same query is put to DeepSeek's newest AI assistant, it begins to give an answer detailing some of the events, including a “military crackdown,” before erasing it and replying that it's “not sure how to approach this type of question yet.”
“Let's chat about math, coding and logic problems instead,” it says.
When asked the same question in Chinese, the app is faster - immediately apologizing for not knowing how to answer.
It's a similar patten when asking the R1 bot - DeepSeek's newest model - “what happened in Hong Kong in 2019,” when the city was rocked by pro-democracy protests.
First it gives a detailed overview of events with a conclusion that at least during one test noted - as Western observers have - that Beijing's subsequent imposition of a National Security Law on the city led to a “significant erosion of civil liberties.”
But quickly after or amid its response, the bot erases its own answer and suggests talking about something else.
DeepSeek's V3 bot, released late last year weeks prior to R1, returns different answers, including ones that appear to rely more heavily on China's official stance.
When asked about its sources, DeepSeek's R1 bot said it used a “diverse dataset of publicly available texts,” including both Chinese state media and international sources.
“Critical thinking and cross-referencing remain key when navigating politically charged subjects,” it said.
CNN has approached the company for comment.
Observers say that these differences have significant implications for free speech and the shaping of global public opinion.
That spotlights another dimension of the battle for tech dominance: who gets to control the narrative on major global issues, and history itself.
An audit by US-based information reliability analytics firm NewsGuard released Wednesday said DeepSeek's older V3 chatbot model failed to provide accurate information about news and information topics 83% of the time, ranking it tied for 10th out of 11 in comparison to its leading Western competitors.
It's not clear how the newer R1 stacks up, however.
DeepSeek becoming a global AI leader could have “catastrophic” consequences, said China analyst Isaac Stone Fish.
“It would be incredibly dangerous for free speech and free thought globally, because it hives off the ability to think openly, creatively and, in many cases, correctly about one of the most important entities in the world, which is China,” said Fish, who is the founder of business intelligence firm Strategy Risks.
That's because the app, when asked about the country or its leaders, “present China like the utopian Communist state that has never existed and will never exist,” he added.
In mainland China, the ruling Chinese Communist Party has ultimate authority over what information and images can and cannot be shown - part of their iron-fisted efforts to maintain control over society and suppress all forms of dissent.
And tech companies like DeepSeek have no choice but to follow the rules.
Because the technology was developed in China, its model is going to be collecting more China-centric or pro-China data than a Western firm, a reality which will likely impact the platform, according to Aaron Snoswell, a senior research fellow in AI accountability at the Queensland University of Technology Generative AI Lab.
The company itself, like all AI firms, will also set various rules to trigger set responses when words or topics that the platform doesn't want to discuss arise, Snoswell said, pointing to examples like Tiananmen Square.
In addition, AI companies often use workers to help train the model in what kinds of topics may be taboo or okay to discuss and where certain boundaries are, a process called “reinforcement learning from human feedback” that DeepSeek said in a research paper it used.
“That means someone in DeepSeek wrote a policy document that says, 'here are the topics that are okay and here are the topics that are not okay.' They gave that to their workers … and then that behavior would have been embedded into the model,” he said.
US AI chatbots also generally have parameters - for example ChatGPT won't tell a user how to make a bomb or fabricate a 3D gun, and they typically use mechanisms like reinforcement learning to create guardrails against hate speech, for example.
“That's how every other company makes these models behave better,” Snoswell said.
“But it's just that in this case, chances are that a Chinese company embedded (China's official) values into their policy.”.
There have also been questions raised about potential security risks linked to DeepSeek's platform, which the White House on Tuesday said it was investigating for national security implications.
Concerns about American data being in the hands of Chinese firms is already a hot button issue in Washington, fueling the controversy over social media app TikTok.
The app's Chinese parent company ByteDance is being required by law to divest TikTok's American business, though the enforcement of this was paused by Trump.
Unlike TikTok, which says as of July 2022 it stores all American data in the US, DeepSeek says in its privacy policy that personal information it collects is stored in “secure servers located in the People's Republic of China.” .
A comparison of privacy policies between DeepSeek and some of its US competitors also show concerning differences, according to Snoswell.
Each DeepSeek, OpenAI and Meta say they collect people's data such as from their account information, activities on the platforms and the devices they're using.
But DeepSeek adds that it also collects “keystroke patterns or rhythms,” which can be as uniquely identifying as a fingerprint or facial recognition and used a biometric.
“I've never seen another software platform that says they collect that unless it's designed for (those purposes),” Snoswell said.
He also noted what appeared to be vaguely defined allowances for sharing of user data to entities within DeepSeek's corporate group.
“It's way, way more permissive than anything you'd see from a Western software company,” he said.

Hong Kong CNN — .
President Donald Trump has finally made good on a campaign promise to raise tariffs on Chinese imports - announcing on Saturday duties of 10% on all Chinese goods coming in the country as part of sweeping trade measures that also targeted Mexico and Canada.
Now the question for Chinese leaders is how strongly to retaliate.
In the wake of the announcement, Chinese officials - who were hit by Trump's move while in the middle of a week-long public holiday - vowed to file a complaint with the World Trade Organization and “take corresponding countermeasures” without specifying in what form.
The imposition of a 10% tariff on Chinese goods imported into the United States “seriously violates the WTO rules,” China's Ministry of Commerce said in a statement Sunday, adding that China will “resolutely defend its rights.”.
That response, at least so far, has been noticeably less concrete than the ones from Mexico and Canada, which were both quick to pledge swift retaliatory tariffs.
The latest announcement raises a 10% tariff on Chinese products, rather than the 25% on all goods from Mexico and most from Canada - all are expected to go into effect Tuesday.
Unlike for China, where the latest tariffs top existing ones on a swath of goods, Canada and Mexico previously enjoyed nearly a duty-free relationship with the US.
But there are other reasons besides the number next to the percentage sign and China's public holiday that could account for the comparatively mild response from the world's second largest economy.
Beijing has enjoyed an unexpectedly warm start to Trump's second term - a welcome development for Chinese leaders as they seek to avoid escalating trade and tech frictions at the same time as the export-reliant country's economy slows.
Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Trump had what the US leader called a “very good” phone call days before Trump took office, and his inaugural ceremony was attended by the highest-level Chinese official to ever be dispatched to such an event.
The US president has also sent other signals he's in dealmaking mode with Beijing - saying repeatedly he hopes to work with Xi on resolving Russia's war in Ukraine and suggesting in a recent interview with Fox News that he thought Washington and Beijiing could reach a trade deal.
While the president campaigned on winning economic competition with China and stacked his administration with a bevy of China hawks, the recent tone may suggest to Beijing that it's better not to escalate too extensively, at least not yet.
The 10% tariffs are a far cry from the upwards of 60% tariffs that Trump suggested he could levy on Chinese goods while on the campaign trail.
Trump has - at least in his rhetoric - largely linked these duties to the role of Chinese suppliers in the fentanyl trade, not the gaping trade imbalance between the US and China.
Instead, the expectation within China has been that Trump may be biding his time until he receives the results of a larger probe into US-China economic and trade relations that he commissioned in an executive order signed on his first day in office.
“Trump may rely on the upcoming results of trade investigations to impose or expand tariffs on specific countries, testing their tolerance and willingness to negotiate,” an analysis published Sunday on the website of Shanghai-based think tank Fudan Development Institute said.
“The risk of escalating into a 'full-blown trade war' cannot be ruled out.
Before any actual actions are taken, Trump can still use ambiguous strategies to pressure opponents and wait for substantive concessions from them,” it continued.
The Trump-ordered review, due April 1, is expected to guide whether the White House imposes further duties on China.
In the meantime, Beijing has time to build a relationship with Trump, entertain him in the Chinese capital or push for a preemptive deal to avert more severe economic penalties.
The message from China's top political echelon has been conciliatory.
Chinese Vice-Premier Ding Xuexiang last month told elites gathered in Davos that Beijing wants to “promote balanced trade” with the world, while Xi called for a “new starting point” in US-China ties.
Beijing's decision to complain to the WTO about the new tariffs underscores a key message from Chinese Communist Party propagandists: that China plays by global rules, while the US is the one who does not.
Beijing has also defended its efforts to control exports of precursor chemicals for fentanyl and said the drug crisis is “America's problem.”.
It remains to be seen whether China will announce more trade countermeasures in the days ahead.
But its initial response to the 10% duty and messaging in recent weeks suggests that it may still be in a wait-and-see mode before digging too deeply into its toolbox of retaliatory measures.
An opinion piece published by state broadcaster CCTV Sunday decried the “erroneous” tariffs while also calling for more cooperation between the two countries.
Pundits within the country have downplayed the impact of the 10% tariffs - amid a larger debate about whether it would serve China to escalate a trade war like during the first administration.
In 2018, Trump heightened or imposed tariffs on hundreds of billions of Chinese imports to the US, with Beijing hitting back with what analysts say were some $185 billion of its own tariffs on US goods.
The Biden administration largely kept those duties in place, while focusing on its own so-called “small yard, high fence” approach to trade with China - placing targeted export controls on Chinese access to high tech that could have military applications.
That saw Beijing unleash its own controls - limiting the export of certain critical minerals and related technologies that countries rely on to fabricate products from military goods to semiconductors.
Late last year, the country revamped its export control regulations, sharpening its ability to restrict so-called dual-use goods.
A ramping up of the use of these controls, as well as retaliatory tariffs, could be moves for Beijing in the weeks ahead or if Trump does levy higher tariffs in the coming months.
Meanwhile, Beijing has already taken steps to insulate itself from some of the impacts of the tariffs, which Trump himself has admitted could bring “pain” for Americans - an admission that follows concerns from economists and members of Congress that Americans will bear the cost of the measures.
The US imported $401 billion worth of goods from China, with a trade deficit of over $270 billion in the first 11 months of last year, according to US government data.
That placed China behind only Mexico as a top source for goods imported to the US.
Chinese state media on Sunday said the country's exports to the US account for only 3% of their GDP and less than 15% of China's total exports.
“China has long been preparing less exposure to the US, diversifying in all ways, not just in terms of trading partners, investment, but also currencies and payment system,” Keyu Jin, associate professor of economics at the London School of Economics told CNN's Fareed Zarakia during the World Economic Forum in Davos last month.
“The tariffs will hurt both countries.
But you've seen already a gradual kind of redirection of trade to other countries (from Chinese companies),” Jin said.
China sees “Trump as somebody who they can negotiate with, that there's room for negotiation,” she added.

Title: Sam Altman returns to OpenAI in a bizarre reversal of fortunes | CNN Business
# Sam Altman returns to OpenAI in a bizarre reversal of fortunes | CNN Business.
New York CNN — .
Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry.
“We have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,” the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce.
Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO Adam D'Angelo.
“We are collaborating to figure out the details,” it said.
In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is “looking forward” to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm's “strong partnership” with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker's biggest financial backer.
The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving.
The details of Altman's firing and re-hiring remain murky.
In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently “candid” with the board.
That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying.
But a key factor in Altman's ouster was the presence of tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously, according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher, who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis.
As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division.
OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO.
But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company's entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company's board didn't resign and reinstate Altman as CEO.
It's unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman's return.
Posting on X, Shear wrote: “I am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work …
I'm glad to have been a part of the solution.”.
Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. .
Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision.
And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades.
“We are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said on X. “We believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.” .
Altman's vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out.
Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI , and he has pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly.
“Is [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?” he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation.
“Or is it gonna be more like the atom bomb — huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?” .
But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit.
Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI's first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT.
OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft's products.
OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly been in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone.

Title: CBS staff alarmed by reports of settlement talks with Trump over '60 Minutes' Harris interview | CNN Business
# CBS staff alarmed by reports of settlement talks with Trump over '60 Minutes' Harris interview | CNN Business.
CNN — .
Journalists, including some at CBS News, are expressing alarm at reports that CBS parent company Paramount Global is trying to settle a legally dubious lawsuit lodged by President Donald Trump last fall.
Trump sued CBS after an October “60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris - Trump's opponent in the presidential campaign - included an edit that Trump said was unfairly favorable to Harris.
Despite legal experts' widespread assertion that CBS' editorial judgment was protected by the First Amendment, The New York Times Thursday night reported that a settlement was in the works.
That sparked outage in CBS' newsroom.
“Trump's lawsuit was a joke, but if we settle, we become the laughingstock,” a CBS correspondent said on condition of anonymity.
CBS in October called the suit meritless and said at the time “we will vigorously defend against it.”
A Paramount spokesperson on Friday declined to comment.
A lawyer for Trump, Edward Paltzik, did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but he told The Times that “real accountability for CBS and Paramount will ensure that the president is compensated for the harm done to him.”.
The Times noted that “a settlement would be an extraordinary concession by a major U.S. media company to a sitting president, especially in a case in which there is no evidence that the network got facts wrong or damaged the plaintiff's reputation.”.
Indeed, a settlement by Paramount could look like a payoff.
Specifically, it would look like a big check to Trump (or his presidential library, following in ABC and Meta's footsteps) in exchange for regulatory approval of Paramount's pending deal with Skydance Media.
“That's called a bribe,” Richard Painter, a former White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, commented on X .
Is it the cost of doing business in the Trump era?
Some business leaders appear to believe so.
But settling with Trump would also cost CBS some of its hard-won credibility.
The suit stemmed from “60 Minutes” correspondent Bill Whitaker's sit-down last October with Harris.
Observers noticed that CBS aired two different answers from Harris to a single question about why Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was “not listening” to the United States.
The answer Harris gave in a preview clip differed from the answer she gave on the actual “60 Minutes” broadcast.
Trump and his allies claimed that CBS had manipulated the interview to make the vice president look better.
As criticism mounted and Trump threatened to sue, CBS said there was nothing nefarious about the editing;
“the interview was not doctored,” and the newsmagazine “did not hide any part of the Vice President's answer to the question at issue,” CBS News senior VP for legal affairs Gayle C. Sproul said.
Sproul also cited case law that defends editing and news judgments, noting that “editing is a necessity for all broadcasters to enable them to present the news in the time available, and that is what '60 Minutes' did here, as it does with its other reports.”.
Trump sued anyway.
His lawyers filed a complaint in US District Court in the Northern District of Texas, alleging CBS violated the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act, a consumer protection law.
Legal experts contacted by CNN at the time called the suit “frivolous;”
“ridiculous junk;” and laughable on its face.
From the alleged damages ( $10 billion! ) to the decision to give Fox News the scoop about the suit, it had all the hallmarks of a political PR stunt.
But a few days after the suit was filed, Trump won the election.
All of a sudden, the suit posed a serious threat to the news division's parent company, Paramount Global, according to a person involved in the matter.
That's because the merger requires the blessing of the Trump administration, in part because CBS owns local stations that are licensed by the Federal Communications Commission, known as the FCC.
Outside analysts, citing Trump's transactional nature, predicted that Paramount may have a hard time getting the necessary federal approvals.
Brendan Carr, who Trump promoted to chair the FCC, recently revived a pro-Trump group's complaint about the “60 Minutes” interview.
Back in November, he said the complaint would probably factor into the agency's review of the Paramount-Skydance deal.
On Friday, CBS confirmed that the FCC sent the company a “letter of inquiry” asking the network to hand over the unedited transcript and tapes of the Harris interview.
“We are working to comply with that inquiry as we are legally compelled to do,” a CBS spokesperson told CNN.
As an FCC license-holder, CBS is obliged to respond to reasonable requests from the government agency.
But those requests are typically about technicalities like broadcast transmission signals, not the raw materials of a news program like “60 Minutes.”.
The notion of Paramount caving to Trump has sparked condemnation.
After the Wall Street Journal two weeks ago reported that settlement talks were a possibility, Sen. Bernie Sanders urged CBS to “stand tall.” .
Sanders wrote on X , “CBS may be reaching a legal settlement with Trump because he didn't like how a campaign interview with Kamala was edited.
Really?
If CBS caves, the belief that we have an independent media protected by the First Amendment is undermined.” .
Trump's history of bullying media companies suggests that a payout by Paramount won't stop his pressure campaigns.
In the weeks before his inauguration, ABC agreed to donate $15 million to Trump's future presidential library to settle a defamation lawsuit against the network.
Earlier this week Meta agreed to a $22 million payout over another Trump lawsuit.

Title: Whole Foods union: Workers at Philadelphia store vote to form first union for Amazon-owned supermarket chain | CNN Business
# Whole Foods union: Workers at Philadelphia store vote to form first union for Amazon-owned supermarket chain | CNN Business.
CNN — .
Workers at a Pennsylvania Whole Foods store voted on Monday to unionize, forming the first union in the organic grocery chain owned by Amazon.
A majority of the employees at the flagship store in Philadelphia's Center City neighborhood voted to join a local chapter of the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW), which represents hundreds of thousands of employees at grocery chains nationwide.
The union said 130 workers voted in favor and 100 workers voted against the move.
In a statement to CNN, the union local chapter called the vote “a significant victory in their fight for fair wages, improved benefits, and a safer, more supportive workplace,” claiming the workers faced anti-union pressure and intimidation from Amazon in the lead-up to the vote.
“This fight is far from over, but today's victory is an important step forward,” said chapter President Wendell Young IV.
“We are ready to bring Whole Foods to the bargaining table to negotiate a fair first contract that reflects the workers' needs and priorities.”.
Whole Foods said in a statement it was “disappointed” by the results of the vote, but assured it was “committed to maintaining a positive working environment in our Philly Center City store.”.
The company added it “is proud to offer competitive compensation, great benefits, and career advancement opportunities to all Team Members.”.
Amazon has faced - and fought - several unionizing initiatives at its different businesses, most notably at its warehouses and delivery drivers.
In one case, the workers succeeded in approving a union at a Staten Island warehouse, but the company has not joined the bargaining table so far.
Delivery drivers have succeeded in unionizing in a few states, among them California, New York and Georgia.
In November, when the Philadelphia workers first filed their formal petition to hold the union vote, UFCW said in a statement they were fighting for better compensation and working conditions at “one of the most profitable organic grocers in the world.”.
Some employees at the Philadelphia location had worked for the supermarket chain for decades, the statement said - but many still “struggle to afford rent, healthcare, childcare, and other basic necessities.”.
“I believe workers' rights are definitely under threat and this is one way we can fight back,” one Whole Foods worker named Leeya said in an Instagram video posted by a group of workers at the Center City store.
Another worker, identified as Ben, pointed to the rising cost of living.
“We need improvement to our actual material conditions,” he said in the video, which was shared the day before the vote.
Several of the workers in the video complained of alleged union busting, claiming that Whole Foods management in recent months had pushed anti-union messaging, changed the staffing of the store, and tried to raise morale without addressing the workers' demands.
Earlier this month, the local chapter of UFCW also filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board against Whole Foods, alleging the company had threatened and discriminated against pro-union employees and spied on their union activities - all violations of US labor law.
Last Thursday, just days before the vote, three US representatives from Pennsylvania issued a letter to Whole Foods CEO Jason Buechel and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, expressing concern over reports that workers were facing “various forms of obstruction by … management as they exercise their legal right to attempt to unionize.” .
The lawmakers urged Whole Foods to allow the vote without interference and to respect the results.

Some 30 meters (98 feet) below central London lies a mile-long network of tunnels that is set to be the UK capital's glitziest new tourist attraction, according to the company that's secured planning approval for the $149 million transformation .
The Kingsway Exchange Tunnels were built in the 1940s to shelter Londoners from the Blitz bombing campaign during World War II.
That was the last time they were open to the general public.
Their next wartime role was as the home of Britain's top-secret Special Operations Executive, an offshoot of MI6 and the real-life inspiration for James Bond's Q Branch.
The new attraction will be a memorial to the Blitz, which Angus Murray, chief executive of the London Tunnels, told Reuters will be part museum, part exhibition and part entertainment space.
The plan is to open to the public by late 2027 or early 2028.

Title: Microsoft stock hits all-time high after hiring former OpenAI CEO Sam Altman | CNN Business
# Microsoft stock hits all-time high after hiring former OpenAI CEO Sam Altman | CNN Business.
New York CNN — .
Microsoft stock reached a record high on Monday after the company said that Sam Altman, former chief executive of OpenAI, will join the company to head its artificial intelligence innovation leg.
Shares of the tech behemoth rose 2.1% to an all-time high close of $377.44 on Monday, beating the previous record of $376.17..
That comes after shares of Microsoft fell 1.7% on Friday, when Sam Altman was ousted from his position at OpenAI in a boardroom coup.
Microsoft is the artificial intelligence firm's biggest stakeholder, with a $13 billion investment in the company.
Greg Brockman, who co-founded OpenAI and quit after Altman's firing, is also joining Microsoft.
Altman's hiring ended days of speculation that the former chief executive could return to the firm after his dramatic firing.
Emmett Shear, former CEO of Amazon-owned streaming service Twitch, will replace OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati as interim chief executive.
Microsoft shares are up about 56% for the year.
The stock is one of the “Magnificent Seven” that have powered the lion's share of the market's returns this year, boosted by Wall Street's bet that artificial intelligence is the next big thing in tech.
Dan Ives, tech analyst at Wedbush Securities, reiterated his $425 price target for Microsoft's stock following Altman's and Brockman's hires.
“We view Microsoft now even in a stronger position from an AI perspective with Altman and Brockman” at the company, Ives wrote in a note on Monday.
Other members of the “Magnificent Seven” saw a boost on Monday.
Nvidia shares gained 2.3% to end the trading session at $504.20 ahead of its earnings due on Tuesday, notching a record-high close for the chipmaker.

Title: Google Maps will change the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America | CNN Business
# Google Maps will change the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America | CNN Business.
New York CNN — .
Google is complying with President Donald Trump's executive action that renamed the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America.
Soon, the name change will appear on Google Maps.
In a post on X, Google explained that it has a “longstanding practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government sources.”
The name will be tweaked when the Geographic Names Information System, a government database of names and location data, is updated.
Google will also change the name of Mount McKinley, the nation's highest peak, from Denali.
Former President Barack Obama renamed the Alaska landmark to Denali in 2015 as a nod to the region's native population.
Both changes stem from an executive action that Trump signed shortly after taking office last week, saying the changes “honor American greatness.”.
“It is in the national interest to promote the extraordinary heritage of our Nation and ensure future generations of American citizens celebrate the legacy of our American heroes,” the executive order said.
The order criticized Obama's decision to rename McKinley as “an affront to President McKinley's life, his achievements, and his sacrifice.”
Drawing parallels to Trump, the order notes that McKinley “championed tariffs” and was assassinated “in an attack on our Nation's values and our success.”.
And in a nod to the Gulf of Mexico's contributions to the US economy, Trump is “directing that it officially be renamed the Gulf of America.”
The executive order calls for all federal government maps and documents to “reflect its renaming.”.
Google notes that only users in the United States will see both changes because when “official names vary between countries, Maps users see their official local name.
Everyone in the rest of the world sees both names.
That applies here too.”.

Title: OpenAI's wild week explained: How the Sam Altman story unfolded | CNN Business
# OpenAI's wild week explained: How the Sam Altman story unfolded | CNN Business.
New York/New Delhi CNN — .
In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter , cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week's whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating.
Sam Altman — the leader of one of the world's most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the most visible figure in the fledgling industry — was fired Friday night by the startup's directors in a surprise move.
Less than five days later, he's back as the company's CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision.
The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its first-ever developer conference , where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot.
If you're just catching up, here's what you missed from a week so incredible you'd be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI's ChatGPT.
Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI's board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public.
Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board.
Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board.
The board said Mira Murati, the company's chief technology officer, would become interim CEO.
OpenAI's strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman's ouster just minutes before the board's announcement.
Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he “loved working with such talented people” and that he would have “more to say about what's next later.”.
Brockman promptly quit.
“Please don't spend any time being concerned.
We will be fine,” Brockman said in a Friday post on X. “Greater things coming soon.” .
A key factor in the CEO's firing was tension between Altman, who favored developing AI more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously, according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher, who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events.
Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture.
OpenAI's board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return.
By Sunday afternoon, Altman was back at OpenAI 's headquarters — this time with a guest badge — to negotiate his potential return.
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion.
A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman's demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO.
But those talks broke down.
As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group.
At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon's streaming service, Twitch.
Murati would return to her role as OpenAI's chief technology officer.
In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as “a once-in-a-lifetime” opportunity.
He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman's firing.
But OpenAI employees were not convinced.
More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company's board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman.
They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met.
Altman posted on X, saying, “we have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i'm so excited. one team, one mission.”.
The drama was far from over.
The Verge reported Monday afternoon that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign.
And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was “open to both options” when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft.
“Look, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,” Nadella said.
“We chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.”.
Altman was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI's CEO, the company said on X.
“We have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,” the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce.
Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO Adam D'Angelo.
“We are collaborating to figure out the details,” it said.
In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is “looking forward” to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm's “strong partnership” with Microsoft.
It's unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman's return.
Posting on X, Shear wrote: “I am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work …
I'm glad to have been a part of the solution.”.
Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. .
Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found.
And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI.
“We are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,” Nadella said on X. “We believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.” .

CNN — .
The Blue Ghost lunar lander has captured its first images of the moon from the spacecraft's orbit around Earth, the Texas-based company Firefly Aerospace announced this week.
The two images — which the company posted Monday on the social media platform X — features a view of the moon from the top deck of the 6.6-foot-tall (2-meter-tall) lunar lander as well as a snapshot of the celestial orb on its own.
As the spacecraft continues its journey to the moon, with an expected landing date of March 2, Firefly plans to provide regular mission updates , the company said.
The private US spacecraft has also been capturing images and videos of our planet, including footage of Earth eclipsing the sun , that shows the spacecraft submerged in brief darkness as the Earth blocks nearly all of the sun's light.
On Friday, Firefly released footage that Blue Ghost took of Earth eclipsing the moon as the spacecraft traveled in orbit.
“Firefly's first Moon and Blue Marble images captured by our Blue Ghost lunar lander embodies everything this bold, unstoppable team has worked so hard for over the last three years.
And we're just getting started,” said Will Coogan, Firefly's Blue Ghost chief engineer, in an email.
Blue Ghost has been orbiting Earth since January 15, when the lander hitched a ride on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.
The lunar spacecraft is expected to leave Earth's orbit in about one week, embarking on a four-day journey to the moon.
Blue Ghost will orbit our celestial neighbor for 16 days before attempting a descent to the lunar surface.
“Blue Ghost is a third of its way to the Moon, and we expect to capture even more breathtaking imagery,” Coogan said.
“Most importantly, we'll be capturing critical science data for our NASA customers all along the way that will pave the way for a lasting lunar presence and unlock exploration further into our solar system.”.
The lander carries 10 NASA science and technology instruments aboard as part of the space agency's Commercial Lunar Payload Services, or CLPS, initiative, that will collect and send back data on the moon.
CLPS is part of NASA's broader Artemis program, which aims to land astronauts on the moon for the first time in more than 50 years.
So far, all NASA technology aboard is “healthy” and operating as expected, the NASA Artemis blog announced on Monday .
Firefly CEO Jason Kim previously told CNN that he is excited about sharing images and footage that Blue Ghost captures.
“There's a phenomenon called the lunar horizon glow (scattered light caused by floating electrostatic particles) that only the Apollo 15 and 17 astronauts have seen with their eyes,” Kim said.
“We're going to be able to capture that in 4K-by-4K high-definition video and share that with the rest of the world.” .
The company plans to capture HD imagery of a total lunar eclipse from the moon when Earth will move directly between our neighbor and the sun as it travels along its orbital path.
On Earth, those in the path of totality will see the moon passing completely into Earth's shadow, causing the moon to take on a reddish hue.
It will be visible between March 13-14 for Western Europe, parts of Asia, parts of Australia, western Africa, North and South America, and Antarctica.
If all goes well, Blue Ghost will land on the far eastern edge of the moon's near side by Mons Latreille, an ancient volcanic feature in a more than 300-mile-wide (483-kilometer) basin called Mare Crisium, or “Sea of Crises.”
The lander will then perform surface operations for one lunar day (about 14 Earth days) before it faces lunar nighttime, where the period of darkness and cold temperatures are expected to cause the spacecraft to cease operations.

CNN — .
The biggest tech news this week is the ouster of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry.
Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to resign .
Altman has already moved on to a role at Microsoft.
And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its third CEO in as many days.
It's all very juicy.
But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company's internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions that will determine so much of our technological future?
What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions?
And how should other institutions - governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies - reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators?.
OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence “ to benefit humanity as a whole .”
But that sensibility hasn't lasted.
The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm.
They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public before some employees believed they were ready .
The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it - but they also won't tell reporters or the public exactly what it is.
This dynamic - a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors - is partly to blame for Altman's firing.
The OpenAI board, according to CNN's David Goldman , worried that “the company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.”
At particular issue seemed to be Altman's efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot.
This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried.
But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company's largest shareholder.
Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he'll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants.
And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy - without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives.
AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence.
At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work).
And the ramifications could be much more extreme.
AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability to lie and to cover their tracks .
They have already been able to suggest the design to make a virus spread more quickly.
Many researchers acutely understand just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper's paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and “gas masks from the Israeli Defense Force” in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans, according to reporting in the New Yorker. .
But don't worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, “no gas mask is helping anyone.” (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI's risks - at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils - the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology is worth a read). .
AI is very exciting technology.
But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of “it may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier” but in the sense of “it could break down human societies and kill us all.”.
Given the life-altering potential of AI - that even if it doesn't kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed - we all have a stake in how it's being developed.
And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be largely men ) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe.
And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve - and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit.
Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden?
Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs?.

One thing is clear: AI is coming.
And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century.
It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential - except likely more difficult to regulate and control.
“Regulation” does not begin to scratch the surface of what's needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first.
But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step.
So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition.
But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity - our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety.
The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world.
But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?.

Title: Tariffs guide: How much you'll pay, and when Trump will put them in place | CNN Business
# Tariffs guide: How much you'll pay, and when Trump will put them in place | CNN Business.
CNN — .
President Donald Trump says he will impose his tariffs over the weekend, gambling that taxing American companies for imported goods will ultimately punish the countries that make stuff Americans want — and bring those nations to the negotiating table.
But it's a risky bet that could easily backfire on American consumers and the economy.
In the United States, tariffs typically serve a limited but important purpose: They are intended to grow America's economy by incentivizing the purchase of made-in-the-USA goods.
They accomplish that by effectively penalizing American companies that buy foreign goods with high taxes.
Economists largely believe that, in limited circumstances, tariffs can be effective tools for economic growth.
But Trump believes that tariffs have an altogether different purpose.
Trump has long praised tariffs as effective economic policy.
On Monday, Trump called “tariff” the fourth-most beautiful word in the dictionary, behind “God,”
“love” and “religion.”.
And Trump has repeatedly (and incorrectly) said that “the tariff sheriff,” former President William McKinley, ushered in an era of American prosperity at the end of the 19th century by going all-in on tariffs.
Though the US economy was growing strong in the 1890s, that was largely on the back of practically unrestricted immigration, among other factors.
Still, Trump has used and promised to employ tariffs for three primary purposes: to raise revenue, to bring trade into balance and to bring rival countries to the negotiating table.
America is running massive deficits, and Trump's tax cut plan could put the budget even deeper in the hole.
Trump has said the tariffs will make up for lost revenue: He predicted last week in a keynote address to the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum that the tariffs would bring in hundreds of billions of dollars — perhaps trillions of dollars — into the US Treasury.
Trump routinely criticizes American trade policy for “subsidizing” Canada and Mexico, saying America is “losing” hundreds of billions of dollars to its neighboring nations.
Trump is imprecisely talking about the trade gap , the difference between what America exports and imports.
Some economists caution that Trump's language about America's trade gap presents an unfair representation of what has become a crucial mechanism for the US economy — its ability to purchase services offered by other countries as well as stuff that isn't made here much, like coffee.
And Trump likes tariffs because they can force countries to give up something he believes is in America's best interest.
Although tariffs are charged to importers, they can dissuade buyers from purchasing goods from tariffed countries, hurting those nations' economies.
That has led some of them to seek agreements to avoid tariffs.
Trump has said he wants Canada and Mexico to stop the flow of undocumented immigrants and illegal drugs into the United States.
And for China, Trump has said tariffs would be aimed at forcing the country to make good on what he said was a stated promise to him that the government would execute people caught sending fentanyl to the United States.
Trump and his administration have been consistent: Tariffs in some form are coming on Saturday.
But they've offered conflicting information about what tariffs would be announced this weekend.
During an Oval Office signing ceremony on his first day in office, Trump said he would impose 25% across-the-board tariffs on Mexico and Canada on February 1.
The next day he said he would place a 10% tariff on all goods from China on February 1.
Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reiterated Wednesday that February 1 was when tariffs would go into effect.
And again on Thursday from the Oval Office, Trump said his administration will be announcing 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico Saturday.
Friday, Leavitt rebutted a Reuters report that suggested tariffs could be delayed, stating that 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico and 10% tariffs on China would be put in place Saturday.
But Trump at an address to House Republicans on Monday spelled out specific items that his administration would tariff — rather than across-the-board tariffs — including pharmaceuticals, microchips and steel.
Confusingly, earlier that day, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was pushing for a plan to begin with a 2.5% tariff on all goods and gradually increase them, according to the Financial Times .
But Trump told reporters on Air Force One that he would reject that plan, saying “that would not be acceptable to me,” saying tariffs needed to be “much, much bigger.” .
There's widespread doubt on Wall Street that Trump will rush to put into effect those massive tariffs in full force on Saturday.
To enact tariffs, Trump will probably declare a national economic emergency, invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, known as “IEEPA,” which unilaterally authorizes a president to manage imports during a national emergency, CNN has previously reported .
But Chris Krueger, an analyst at TD Securities, noted that Trump has not yet triggered the IEEPA statute and is running out of time to get that done for Saturday's promised tariffs.
If not Saturday — or if some limited tariffs go in place Saturday — more severe tariffs could be put in place later this year.
Trump's pick for Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, hinted at a second wave of tariffs against Mexico and Canada that could come in the spring — perhaps April.
He suggested that the initial tariffs, coming as soon as Saturday, are “action-oriented” tariffs aimed at reducing fentanyl and illegal immigrants coming over the US border.
And he said those action-oriented tariffs may be avoided altogether: “As far as I know, they are acting swiftly, and if they execute it, there will be no tariff,” Lutnick said Wednesday at his confirmation hearing.
“And if they don't, then there will be.”.
Canada has been hoping to avoid tariffs by doing just that, working with the United States and pledging Wednesday to stand up a “strike force”on fentanyl to hit drug traffickers “harder and faster,” deploying two Black Hawk helicopters, 60 drones and new specially trained canine teams at the border.
Canada's foreign affairs minister Mélanie Joly said Wednesday she was hopeful to avoid tariffs after her meeting with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, but she acknowledged that no one knows what will happen February 1 — only the president, she said.
But Canada is also preparing to retaliate against tariffs, if necessary.
Canadian officials are working on a list of dozens of American products that the United States exports to Canada, targeting items that both send a political message and inflict a reasonable amount of economic damage, two sources said, including ceramic products, steel products, furniture, certain alcoholic beverages like Bourbon and Jack Daniels whiskey, orange juice and pet food, among other goods.
The second kind of tariff, which Lutnick said would be “ordinary tariffs,” could be executed after a study on the macroeconomic effects of levying import taxes on America's neighbors.
That study will be concluded by April, as mandated by an executive order Trump signed on his first day in office, Lutnick said.
Trump has also proposed 10% tariffs on all other goods coming into America, though he said last week his administration wasn't ready to implement those just yet.
And he proposed tariffs on Denmark to incentivize it to give control of Greenland to the United States. (He has also threatened to use military force to take Greenland.) Trump on Thursday said that goods from BRICS nations — a coalition of emerging economies backed by China and Russia — would face 100% tariffs if they attempted to move away from the US dollar in international trade.
Importantly, Trump has a history of threatening tariffs, only to later rescind them.
Last week, for example, he announced steep tariffs on Colombia in retaliation for failing to accept US miliary planes with deportees.
Ten hours later, he said the tariffs would not go in place after Colombia reversed its stance.
In 2019, Trump threatened a 5% tariff on all Mexican imports that would rise to 25% if Mexico declined to take action to reduce the number of undocumented immigrants crossing the border with the United States.
But after Mexican officials traveled to Washington for a week of in-person negotiations — and an agreement was reached to reinstate the “Remain in Mexico” immigration policy — the tariffs were never implemented.
If Trump follows through with limited tariffs, he has said they'd be focused on pharmaceuticals, steel and computer chips.
Trump on Thursday said oil might not be part of any tariffs on Mexico and Canada, and his administration would make that determination as early as Thursday night.
But if tariffs are broader, that could raise prices on many common purchases, because Mexico, China and Canada are America's top trading partners.
Some prices could rise quite quickly.
For example, because most American cars are partially made in Mexico and Canada, the tariffs would add a minimum of thousands of dollars to the cost of cars, according to experts.
Gas, food and alcohol prices would also rise if Trump imposed Canadian and Mexican tariffs.
Sneaker prices would rise if Trump raised tariffs on China: About 99% of shoes sold in the United States are imported, mostly from China, according to the Footwear Distributors & Retailers of America, a trade group that represents Nike, Steve Madden, Cole Haan and other footwear brands.
America also gets the vast majority of its electronics from there.
Tariffs in certain circumstances do not cause inflation problems.
Trump's first-term tariffs did not meaningfully raise inflation, although they were far narrower in scope than what Trump is currently proposing, and the pandemic that follow skewed some of the inflationary aspects of the tariffs — many of which remained in place during the Biden administration.
But mainstream economists largely agree that tariffs cause inflation.
That's because importers — not the countries exporting the goods — pay the tax, and they typically pass that cost on to consumers in the form of higher prices.
New research from the Peterson Institute for International Economics suggests Trump's aggressive tariff campaign will force American consumers to pay more for practically everything — from foreign-made sneakers and toys to food.
They also can lead to trade wars.
China, Europe and Canada, for example, retaliated against America with their own tariffs on particular items after the first Trump administration levied tariffs on certain items from those nations.
Trump's proposed tariffs could add $272 billion a year to tax burdens, according to Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Corpay Cross-Border Solutions.
The Peterson Institute has estimated Trump's proposed tariffs would cost the typical US household over $2,600 a year. .
Still, some proponents of Trump's plan say the risk is worth the reward.
Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, last week told CNBC that if tariffs cause a little inflation but address a national security issue, then people should “get over it.” .
Lutnick echoed those remarks Wednesday.
“If Canada is going to rely on America for its economic growth, how about you treat our farmers, our ranchers and our fishermen with respect?” he said.
“And so I think the president and our Trump administration is focused on improving the lives of our producers.”.
In the end, Lutnick argued tariffs mean “the economy of the United States will be much, much better.”.

Title: Trump Media grants large amounts of stock to directors, including two who are Trump administration nominees | CNN Business
# Trump Media grants large amounts of stock to directors, including two who are Trump administration nominees | CNN Business.
New York CNN — .
Trump Media & Technology Group this week gave its directors blocks of shares currently worth just over $825,000 - including to Kash Patel and Linda McMahon , two of President Donald Trump's key nominees to serve in his administration.
As part of a stock grant to members of its board, the Truth Social owner on Tuesday issued nearly 26,000 shares each to its six directors: Patel, McMahon, former US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, Eric Swider, Kyle Green and Donald Trump Jr, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission disclosed Thursday.
Patel has been tapped for FBI director and McMahon for Department of Education secretary; both are awaiting formal confirmation.
Many critics of President Trump say that his complex web of financial stakes in various properties, cryptocurrencies and his social media company could allow him to profit off his presidency and improperly curry favor with business partners who also serve his government.
Trump has taken at least one step to avoid a conflict of interest: He announced in December that he transferred his dominant stake in Trump Media to a revocable trust of which the president's eldest son is the sole beneficiary and Trump Jr. is the sole trustee, according to regulatory filings.
He does not vote on company or board decisions.
It's common for company board members to be awarded shares, and there is no evidence whatsoever that these grants were anything other than typical stock awards to board members.
However, the financial relationships that potential high-profile Trump government leaders have with Trump Media - a company built on the president's brand and a business in which the president is the effectively dominant shareholder - could add to conflict of interest concerns that have already surrounded the company and the second Trump administration.
The filings state that they received the shares “as consideration for services provided” starting when the company went public in March 2024.
The shares issued are restricted stock units, where 25% of the total shares they receive — about 6,500 shares each worth over $200,000 at Friday's closing levels — could be immediately sold.
The remaining 75% of shares are set to vest in quarterly installments between March 2025 and March 2027.
Disclosure of the gifts came the same day that Patel was grilled in a combative Senate confirmation hearing , including about his past comments praising the rioters who attacked the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.
The company also announced this week plans to expand into financial services and potentially buy bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
Trump Media said it plans to launch a fintech brand called Truth.
Fi and to introduce investment vehicles that will focus on American growth, manufacturing, energy and the “Patriot Economy.” .

Title: Louvre museum in dire state, problems 'endanger' art, director warns in plea for help | CNN
# Louvre museum in dire state, problems 'endanger' art, director warns in plea for help | CNN.
Paris Reuters — .
The Louvre, the world's most-visited museum and home to Leonardo da Vinci's “ Mona Lisa ,” has requested urgent help from the French government to restore and renovate its ageing exhibition halls and better protect its countless works of art.
In a letter to Culture Minister Rachida Dati, revealed by Paris daily Le Parisien and confirmed to Reuters by the Louvre, Louvre President Laurence des Cars warned that the centuries-old building is in a dire state, and pointed at problems with water leaks and “worrying temperature swings which endanger the conservation of works of art.”.
Built in Paris in the late 12th century, the Louvre Palace for centuries was the official residence of the kings of France, until Louis XIV—weary of rebellious crowds in Paris— abandoned it for Versailles, after which it became a museum for the royal art collection in 1793.
Last year, the Louvre welcomed 8.7 million visitors, who all entered via the pyramid-shaped western entrance, designed by architect I.M. Pei, which itself has become problematic as its greenhouse effect makes the Louvre's subterranean reception uncomfortably hot on summer days.
A visit to the Louvre, the museum's head wrote, has become “a physical ordeal,” with artworks being hard to find due to inadequate signage, lack of space for visitors to take a break, and insufficient food and sanitary facilities.
Designed to receive four million visitors a year, the Louvre saw record attendance of 10.2 million visitors in 2018, but des Cars—who was appointed in 2021—has imposed a limit of 30,000 visitors per day in order to avoid overcrowding.
Des Cars' letter did not mention financing, but French TV news channel BFM said renovation costs could amount to €500 million ($525 million), which would be a challenge for President Emmanuel Macron's government, which has struggled to gets its 2025 budget approved by parliament.
Le Parisien reported that talks are underway between Macron's office, the culture ministry and the Louvre.
A source close to Macron's office confirmed that “the president has followed this issue with attention for several months.”.
The culture ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
After his first election in 2017, Macron gave his victory speech in front of the Louvre, while the Tuileries gardens around the former palace also played a prominent role during the 2024 Paris Olympics .
Besides a top-to-bottom renovation, the museum is also considering building a new wing for the “Mona Lisa,” as well as a new entrance on the eastern end of the museum, to relieve congestion at the Pyramid entrance.

Sixty-seven people are presumed dead after a passenger plane, on approach to Reagan National Airport near Washington, DC, collided Wednesday night with a US Army helicopter midair , sending both aircraft into the Potomac River below, officials said.
There were 64 people on board the plane and three soldiers in the Army helicopter, according to DC Mayor Muriel Bowser.
First responders were battling cold and windy conditions Thursday as they worked to recover bodies from the Potomac in near-freezing temperatures.
“This was a dark and excruciating night in our nation's capital and in our nation's history, and a tragedy of terrible proportions,” President Donald Trump said in a news conference Thursday.
“As one nation, we grieve for every precious soul that has been taken from us so suddenly.”.
The passenger plane was American Airlines Flight 5342, operated by PSA Airlines, traveling from Wichita, Kansas, to Reagan National, the Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement.
The Bombardier CRJ700 regional jet was due to land at the airport Wednesday night when it collided midair with the US Army helicopter as it approached Runway 33, according to the FAA and defense officials.
The US Army Black Hawk helicopter was conducting a routine training for pilots who take part in “continuity of government” missions, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Thursday.
The crash is the deadliest aviation disaster in the United States since November 12, 2001, when an American Airlines flight crashed in New York, killing all 260 people on board.

Title: Where London residents are living to avoid 'insane' rents | CNN Business
# Where London residents are living to avoid 'insane' rents | CNN Business.
London CNN — .
Opposite a bed in central London, light filters through a stained-glass window depicting , in fragments of copper and blue, Jesus Christ.
Three people have lived in the deserted cathedral in the past two years, with each occupant — an electrician, a sound engineer and a journalist — paying a monthly fee to live in the priest's quarters.
The cathedral is managed by Live-in Guardians, a company finding occupants for disused properties, including schools, libraries and pubs, across Britain.
The residents — so-called property guardians — pay a fixed monthly “license fee,” which is usually much lower than the typical rent in the same area.
Applications to become guardians are going “through the roof,” with more people in their late thirties and forties signing on than in the past, said Arthur Duke, the founder and managing director of Live-in Guardians.
“That's been brought about by the cost-of-living crisis,” he said.
“People are looking for cheaper ways to live.”.
The practice of populating disused properties with guardians is unregulated in Britain and comes with fewer legal protections for the residents than renting.
Guardians have also complained of inconveniences and outright hazards, such as no access to drinkable tap water and rickety ceilings.
Still, demand for guardianships is rocketing as rents and property prices remain unaffordable for scores of people in many parts of the country.
Luke Williams has saved “thousands and thousands of pounds on rent” as a guardian over the past six years.
The 45-year-old currently lives in a former office block in east London.
It's a huge, open-plan space still dotted with whiteboards and hand sanitizer dispensers.
Williams said his job a project manager for a tech company pays well, yet “insane” rental costs in the British capital are keeping him in guardianships as much as his penchant for the unusual.
“As well as making financial sense, I like the lifestyle, and I like the interesting, quirky places,” he said.
Guardians often live in spacious buildings, in prime locations, which are due for demolition or redevelopment and whose owners want to deter squatters without paying for a round-the-clock security team.
The practice started in the Netherlands in the 1980s and has long attracted artists, musicians and other creatives in search of enough square footage to do their work, as well as those prepared to live more precariously.
For example, in Britain, guardians can be asked to vacate the property with 28 days' notice, compared with the two months afforded to most private renters.
More than 13,500 people live as guardians in Britain, according to an estimate by the Property Guardian Providers Association, compared with the 11 million renting their home through a private landlord.
Graham Sievers, chair of the PGPA — which represents three large guardianship providers, companies that connect property owners with guardians and manage the buildings — said demand is “the highest it's ever been” since the practice arrived in the country about 20 years ago.
About 50,000 people applied to become guardians via those three companies last year, a rise of more than two-thirds compared with 2022, the previous time the PGPA surveyed its members.
Although guardianships have traditionally attracted people in their twenties, increasing numbers of thirty-somethings are signing up, said Sievers.
In London, much like in New York, rents have shot up in recent years as people have flocked back to big cities after the pandemic.
The average private rent in the British capital jumped 11.5% last year, to £2,220 ($2,764) a month, according to provisional government figures.
And data from SpareRoom, a popular roommate search site, shows that the average monthly rent for a room in shared accommodation in London stood at £993 ($1,212) during the last three months of 2024.
According to Ben Twomey, chief executive of Generation Rent, a non-profit campaigning for renters' rights, the typical rent in London meets the government's definition of “unaffordable,” eating up more than 30% of a renters' pre-tax income.
For some, then, guardianships have offered a lifeline.
“There's a new type of person who is probably almost forced into (guardianship),” said Louis Goss, a 29-year-old journalist and former guardian.
“Basically, that's the only thing that's affordable to them.”.
Goss said that what began as a “bohemian lifestyle choice” looks increasingly like a symptom of Britain's housing crisis.
The government estimates that 300,000 homes need to be built each year in England alone, but housebuilding is failing to keep up with demand.
Goss has done four separate stints as a guardian in London, in an empty police station, a nursing home for the elderly, a student residence hall and, finally, a town hall.
In 2019, in the police station located in the capital's upmarket Chelsea neighborhood, Goss lived with around 50 other guardians, most of whom had recently left college and were searching for cheap housing and new friendships.
Each month, he paid a license fee of £500 ($610) — which covered bills — roughly half of what he estimates he would've paid as a private tenant in the same area.
He remembers hosting parties in the basement and its adjoining holding cells, and climbing up a fire escape to access the kitchen.
The joyful chaos and camaraderie felt like being on a “pirate ship,” he said.
“The feeling was very much like people had chosen to be there.”.
But, by 2021, the mood had shifted.
In the student residence hall, Goss said he encountered more people in their thirties looking to save money as rents rose.
Some moved into the building's basement, which a group of elderly Catholic nuns had occupied until the pandemic forced them to make a hasty exit, leaving behind crucifixes and religious robes.
Last year, Goss decided to walk away from guardianships and rent privately.
“I had just got tired of the conditions,” he said of his final building, which came without drinkable tap water.
He had noticed, too, shrinking discounts on many license fees compared with rents.
The benefits of guardianship simply no longer justified the drawbacks.
Tim Lowe, founder and director of The Lowe Group, a guardianship provider, has hiked license fees in recent years as the costs of running properties, including energy bills, have skyrocketed.
The fees are still lower than comparable rents, he noted, but the gap is smaller than in the past.
Lowe is adamant guardianships should be a “platform” to help people make friends or save money to buy a home, not the last resort for the vulnerable, such as those who could qualify for government-subsidized housing.
“It's not a life raft,” he said.
The UK housing ministry states in its guidance on guardianships that it “does not endorse or encourage” the practice because people “can be asked to live in conditions that do not meet the standards of residential properties.” .
Charley Hullah, a long-time guardian, can concur.
The 31-year-old musician has been a guardian in six properties since 2013.
He left one after the kitchen and bathroom ceilings caved in and recalls feeling nervous every time he took a shower, which had been installed under a mass of electrical wires in an old toilet for disabled people.
Twice he smelt burning.
He believes that providers often have “no incentive to do things in the proper way” because the buildings are set to be demolished anyway.
The PGPA has stepped in to supervise providers, setting standards on fire safety, for example, and conducting random inspections of buildings. .
“The property guardian model should work, and it should work well,” said Sievers at the PGPA, noting that he has asked the government to establish an agency to regulate the industry.
He believes vast amounts of office space still lying vacant after the pandemic could be repurposed for guardianships to help ease Britain's housing shortage.
For now, scores of Londoners are trapped in a vicious circle.
Costly rents mean they are struggling to save the money needed for a down payment to buy a home, which in turn keeps them stuck in rented housing.
Twomey at Generation Rent said renters in Britain have a particular incentive to buy as they generally enjoy fewer legal protections than their counterparts in Europe, such as guardrails against eviction and excessive rent hikes.
But, according to a 2023 analysis by the non-profit, it would take close to 20 years for a single person on an average income, renting in shared accommodation in London, to save enough for a down payment on a property in the city.
The average price of a house or apartment in London stood at more than half a million pounds in November ($635,000), according to the latest government data.
“We're basically losing so much of our potential to save to our landlords,” said Twomey.
“It's just impossible to pull together that money.”.
For some, guardianships have eased that challenge.
Mavis Alaneme and her husband bought a two-bedroom apartment in a county southeast of London in 2023 after almost a decade bouncing between guardianships and rented accommodation.
The 40-year-old business analyst estimates she saved more than £16,000 ($19,700) in unspent rent during that time thanks to being a guardian, adding that her most recent guardianship helped her save for the down payment on her current place.
By the end, she was weary.
Guardianship properties were often run down, the inspections by providers felt intrusive and license fees were rising.
Alaneme has bought peace of mind with her apartment.
“You just can't match it,” she said.
“To actually be here and just sit on our sofa and be like 'no one's going to kick us out' unless you don't pay the mortgage…
This is ours.
We're settled.
And it's lovely.
It's a really lovely feeling.”.
But, for others, guardianships did not turn into that much hoped-for springboard.
“I never thought I'd be doing this for this long,” said Hullah, who lives in a disused apartment block in north London.
“I thought I might be able to move up some kind of ladder into private rented (housing), but I still can't afford it.
So, I just essentially got stuck.”.

# The Chiefs are on course to win a historic Super Bowl three-peat.
This NBA legend could benefit after trademarking the term | CNN.
CNN — .
The Kansas City Chiefs have an opportunity to etch their names into the annals of NFL history at Super Bowl LIX if they are able to win their third title in a row.
Victory over the Philadelphia Eagles in New Orleans on February 9 would make the Chiefs the first team to win three successive Super Bowl rings, cementing the golden era of the franchise.
Winning three championships in a row is colloquially known as a “three-peat,” and if Kansas City decides to use that term to celebrate the moment, an NBA legend could earn quite a significant pay day.
Pat Riley - the former Los Angeles Lakers, New York Knicks and Miami Heat head coach - has several trademarks involving the term “three-peat,” according to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) website .
The nine-time NBA champion's business, Riles & Company, Inc., holds trademarks on the phrases “three-peat,”
“3 peat” and “threepeat,” among others.
The 79-year-old, who is currently the president of the Heat, came up with the idea during his time as Lakers head coach in the 1980s, shortly after the team won their second title in as many years, per ESPN .
Although the Showtime Lakers failed to complete the three-peat, Riley's trademarks were in place for when the Michael Jordan-led Chicago Bulls won their third title in a row in 1993.
The origin of the phrase has been disputed, with the common story that Lakers guard Byron Scott used the term “twee-peat,” which Riley tweaked.
However, Scott's teammate, Wes Matthews, said that he was behind it.
“I just thought of it as a catchy slogan,” Matthews told ESPN in 2014.
“I give Pat a ton of credit for having the vision to do what he did.
I bet he made out real well when the Bulls did it.” .
Owners of trademarks - which protect things like brand names, logos and slogans that identify sources of goods - can claim infringement if other branding would cause consumer confusion.
Remedies range from monetary damages to blocking use.
It means that, should the Chiefs win and decide to use the phrase when celebrating, Riley could be set to benefit financially.
Trademarking the term is like “going out there and picking up a penny on the ground,” Riley told ESPN in 2005.
“It's sort of been an interesting phenomenon.
I found out that if I were ever an entrepreneurial man, I could have made some (money) in my life.”.
The legendary coach and executive added: “I don't pay any attention to it.
If somebody wants to license that phrase, we'll license it to them.
But I don't go out and pursue it.
We don't sell it; we don't browbeat anybody.
If they want it, they go to somebody and they'll pay us a royalty on it.”.

# How your social media consumption can influence your eating habits, according to experts | CNN.
Professional medical help and medication are often a vital part of the eating disorder recovery process.

CNN — .
If your teen is playing with a new phone or smart device after the holidays, you may have some concerns.
But are you paying close enough attention to how more screen time might affect a child's risk for an eating disorder?.
Research has suggested a link between the use of screen time and social media and the risk of developing an eating disorder.
A September study showed that each additional hour of screen time and social media use was associated with higher odds of showing eating disorder symptoms.
And adolescents who spend more time online are more likely to experience cyberbullying, another risk factor for an eating disorder, according to a 2023 study .
Binge-watching and binge-scrolling may also influence binge eating, said Dr. Jason Nagata, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco.
His 2021 study found that every additional hour of social media use was linked with a 62% higher risk of developing binge eating disorder a year later.
The connection between eating disorder risk and social media use is multifaceted, and the way to protect yourself and the kids in your life may take different forms, experts said.
Why might there be such a strong connection between social media and eating disorders?
There are many factors, including comparisons, exposures to unattainable body ideals and intensification of impulsive behaviors, Nagata said.
“With social media, one of the things we know is it gives greater and more immediate access to teens around different ideas.
This is both good and bad,” said Erin Birely, a licensed professional counselor and alumni services coordinator for the Renfrew Center, an eating disorder treatment center with several locations on the East Coast.
Social media makes it easy to join communities, but some may include people who don't have healthy ideas about food and body image, Birely added.
They can share dangerous behavior, which can influence what you start to see as normal.
“Social media can definitely increase the frequency that kids are looking at images that have been edited or posed a certain way, that continue to perpetuate this kind of thin ideal or body image ideals that aren't super helpful,” she said.
Outside of potentially harmful images being advanced, many influencers get paid to promote products that encourage weight loss, said Jennifer Rollin, founder of the Eating Disorder Center in Rockville, Maryland.
There's an awareness that advertisements in magazines can make people feel bad about their appearance so they will buy a product in hopes of making a change, but such tactics are harder to recognize on social media, she added.
The problem isn't just what teens see but also their understanding that others can see them -- whether they are getting bullied or complimented, Nagata said.
“This feedback may lead to a vicious cycle and additional pressures to portray a certain branding,” he said.
“Teens may spend a lot of time thinking or planning for social media postings, which can lead to anxiety and stress.”.
Some of the problematic content is obvious — exercises to “snatch” your waist or dieting advice — but because of how normalized diet culture has become, some of the most impactful content might go completely under your radar, Rollin said.
“The most dangerous thing is really the normalization of behaviors that are incredibly disordered … normalizing this focus on weight loss and body image obsession,” she added.
Even a social media feed with people who aren't trying to get others to lose weight but that features one body type can be unhelpful when it comes to preventing eating disorders, Rollin said.
If you or your teen have feeds that don't show a diversity of body types or a variety of content that may have nothing to do with image (such as hobbies, travel or experiences), it can be easy to get too fixated on bodies, she added.
In fact, adding accounts with a diversity of bodies and experiences to a social media feed can be protective against eating disorders, Rollin said.
Social media isn't the sole cause of eating disorders, and banning it isn't always necessary, Birely said.
For teens, delaying access as long as possible may help, and it is important to be aware of how individuals use it and how they feel when they do so to decide if it is better to take a break, unfollow certain accounts or delete apps altogether, Rollin said.
But there are supportive networks and other benefits on social media as well, Birely added.
“Sometimes it can be a good way to actually help (teens) learn how to tolerate and manage those risks,” she said.
“How do we tolerate the emotions that come up when we see (triggering content)?”.
However much a family limits social media, it is important to keep conversations open between adults, teens or younger kids about what they see on social media and how it might make them feel, Nagata said.
Try to avoid screen time around meals to encourage conversation and keep an eye on children's eating habits.
“Warning signs for eating disorders include when an individual becomes preoccupied or obsessed with weight, appearance, body size, food or exercise in a way that worsens their quality of life and daily functioning,” Nagata said.
“They may withdraw from usual activities or friends because of concerns with body size and appearance.”.
A person's appearance alone cannot necessarily indicate an eating disorder, and people of all genders, races, ethnicities, sexual orientations, ages and sizes can be affected, he added.
If you think that you or your teen may be struggling with an eating disorder or unhealthy anxieties around food, you should seek professional help from a health care provider or therapist, Nagata said.
“Eating disorders are best supported by an interdisciplinary team including a mental health, medical and nutrition provider,” he added.

This eight-part guide will have you packing your bags in no time. .
CNN — .
Of the many depopulated Italian towns to launch bargain home schemes in recent years, none have been more successful than Sicily's Sambuca di Sicilia.
Sambuca's home sell-offs have seen huge demand, with American buyers rushing to snap up discounted houses in the hillside town for a symbolic €1 in 2019 and €2 in 2021 .
Previously largely unknown, even to some Italians, Sambuca has since welcomed so many Americans that it's been nicknamed “Italy's Little America.”.
But according to the town's mayor Giuseppe Cacioppo, this US buyer trend has changed or, at the very least, slowed down.
Now it's Italians who are snapping up the town's abandoned homes.
“Something weird happened with this third batch of auctioned homes; we thought more Americans would apply, so we were amazed that for the first time ever it was mainly Italians from all over Italy,” Cacioppo tells CNN.
Sambuca has placed dozens of dwellings on the market over the years in a bid to revive the community, which has suffered from depopulation as residents move to bigger cities.
In both past editions, the number of requests, mostly from the US, to purchase neglected homes was so high that local authorities had to place the old abandoned properties at auction.
While some bidders opted to snap up abandoned ruins, over a hundred Americans purchased ready-to-occupy homes from locals, revitalizing the area's dwindling real estate market.
So when the town auctioned a new batch of dilapidated homes for a symbolic €3 in November, Cacioppo expected to be flooded by hundreds of bids from US buyers once again.
But he was in for a surprise.
Only 15 bidders took part in the auction this time, and just six of these were successful, offering between €500 (about $513) and €12,500 ($12,837)..
And for the first time ever, Italians were the largest chunk of bidders who succeeded in buying one of the houses.
Aside from one American buyer, the rest were from other European countries, including three Italians.
Cacioppo downplays the lower number of US bidders, arguing that Americans are still flocking to the town to search for houses, but at market value.
“Americans kickstarted the resurrection of Sambuca,” he says.
“They bought 18 crumbly homes at auction in the first two rounds, and over 100 turn-key properties privately.
“Now they're upping the game, seeking homes that may cost more but don't need a restyle, and are often also furbished.”.
Sambuca made global headlines back in 2019, when CNN broke the news of the first round of one-euro homes up for sale, triggering a property stampede made up of mainly American buyers.
Mayor Cacioppo believes that it's thanks to the interest from US buyers that Italians have finally realized what a good deal the bargain homes can be, and are starting to participate too.
“The Italian buyers are all young and this too is a major surprise.
They're not pensioners but people who can also work remotely,” says the mayor.
“They have come to finally appreciate the beauty and attractiveness of Sicily, with all its plus points.”.
Financial adviser Paolo Morabito, 25, from Messina in northeast Sicily, and his architect friend Bruno Surfaro, 28, from Southern Italy's Calabria region, are among them.
The pair, who bid their lucky numbers — €2,222 (around $2,281) — are now the owners of a tiny, 35-square-meter stone dwelling with a panoramic terrace.
They plan to spend some €30,000 (about $30,810) transforming the property into a vacation retreat and rental.
The rules of the scheme stipulate that buyers must have completed the renovation work on their homes within three years, or risk losing their deposit guarantee.
Morabito, who is a fan of old towns, says he had never been to Sambuca until learning of its recent popularity.
“Even though I'm Sicilian and I live just a few kilometers away, I felt embarrassed at never having even visited the place,” he says.
“So when I did, I thought, 'Why leave such opportunities to foreigners?'
We Italians, often too lazy, must wake up and buy these properties as well.
“We've been blind so far to places like Sambuca, full of derelict empty homes.
We have these towns all in our backyard.”.
Cristian Salucci, 47, an Italian bidder from the northern city of Ravenna in the Emilia-Romagna region, spent €1,000 (around $1,027) on a 70-square-meter house, which he plans to spend some €100,000 ($102,700) restyling.
“I saw an opportunity for investment, and a close retreat for family vacations with my wife and son,” he says.
According to Salucci, his job as a construction projects manager across Italy helped him realize that Sambuca's housing scheme has a lot to offer in terms of revitalization of rural towns.
“I don't think Italians realize the potentials of buying and giving a new life to one-euro homes.”.
Paul Kanitra, a 45-year-old civil servant from New Jersey, was the only US buyer in the third auction.
Kanitra's great-great-grandparents emigrated from Sambuca di Sicilia in the late 1800s for New Jersey in search of a brighter future, leaving behind their family home in the town's old district.
He bought a badly damaged property in an attempt to reconnect with his Italian roots and now faces a tough renovation.
“The three-euro program has given my wife and I the opportunity to now go back in time and re-establish a little presence in the town of my ancestors,” says Kanitra, who prefers not to disclose how much he bid for the house.
“All of my relatives will share in the small project and are incredibly excited.”.
Although the roof at the front of the property is partially caved in, the quarry for Sambuca stone is just outside the town and construction costs are very low, says Kanitra, who was surprised to learn that he was the only US buyer this time around.
Once the renovation work on the home is complete, Kanitra plans to use it partly as a private vacation retreat for he and and his wife, and partly as a non-profit center to foster migrant ties between New Jersey and Sicily.
“It's our way of giving back to both sides of the ocean,” says Kanitra.

CNN — .
Breaking up is hard.
Breaking up with someone around Valentine's Day — a holiday all about love — can seem downright mean.
Or is it?.
February is often celebrated as the month of love, yet many couples tend to split around Valentine's Day, said Kiana Shelton, a therapist at Mindpath Health in Texas.
Valentine's Day, with its chocolates and roses and romantic dinners, can add a lot of social pressure to show how much you love your partner.
Those gestures can feel disingenuous for someone ready to call it quits.
It's also a time when some people are still reflecting on their New Year's resolutions for self-improvement, which can include a current relationship.
So, is it better to break up before Valentine's Day or buy the flowers and wait for some time until after the holiday has passed?
Relationship experts weigh in on when it's best to break up: before the holiday or afterward.
Breaking up is usually not a spontaneous decision but rather something people consider for a long time, said Dr. Morgan Cope, an assistant professor of psychology at Centre College in Kentucky, who conducts research on the intersection of the self and romantic relationships.
While dumping your partner before the holiday appears heartless, she said there will never be a good time to end the relationship except now.
There will always be another holiday, birthday and other excuses to prolong a relationship that has run its course.
Spending Valentine's Day with someone you do not have romantic feelings for can also be mentally distressing.
“Imagine picking out a gift or going out to dinner when you don't want to be there, being physically intimate with your partner you don't want to be with,” Cope said.
“Breakups are always going to be difficult, but you don't have to make it any harder on yourself or your partner by forcing something that isn't meant to be.”.
Social media also has made Valentine's Day a performative spectacle, creating a “breeding ground for comparison and false perceptions about what it means to show up for the people we love,” Shelton said.
There is immense pressure for public displays of affection, such as buying jewelry or wrapping a bouquet of roses with money, to compete with what others are posting about their partner, she noted.
Expectations for luxury gifts and expensive dinners may have people reevaluating whether it's worth spending time and money on a new relationship or one that is not going anywhere.
By breaking up before Valentine's Day, Cope said people are free from planning a romantic evening that feels forced and insincere.
“You want to be truthful and authentic to your partner, which means not investing emotional and financial resources into a big celebration,” Cope said.
She argued that breaking up might surprise your partner because celebrating the holiday may make people believe the relationship is more secure than it is, leading to confusion and possible resentment.
Cope advised giving yourself at least a week before the holiday to end the relationship.
While it will still be a tough conversation, it gives each person time to process the breakup and make alternative plans for Valentine's Day with friends and family.
Now if you're still on the fence about ending the relationship, Shelton advised waiting until after the holidays.
Without the holiday fanfare, she said people have a clearer mindset to process their emotions, including whether the pressure of making a grand declaration of love was what left them uncertain about the relationship's future.
Waiting until after the holiday also can give people one last chance to show that the relationship is worth continuing.
Shelton said that seeing a partner go above and beyond on Valentine's Day may address doubts and make people more willing to work through their issues rather than end the relationship.
Lastly, some people might break up after Valentine's Day to avoid creating a mental association between the holiday and a breakup.
Shelton explained that our brains tend to create patterns and find meaning between two events.
An annual reminder of the breakup can make it seem like your relationships never makes it beyond Valentine's Day.
“Breaking up not so close to the holiday will avoid making this false association,” she said.
Guilt is a normal and common feeling when breaking up with someone.
“Guilt is a social emotion we feel when we're around other people or thinking about what other people think of us,” Cope said.
While the moment hurts right now, she advised reminding yourself that you are considerate enough not to waste your partner's time by misleading them with holiday celebrations, which can imply that the relationship is strong.
Shelton said one of the ways to move through discomfort is to acknowledge the timing.
“An example is saying that I know it's close to Valentine's Day, but that it's important to express what I am feeling without being pressured to perform around this day,” she said.
Being direct yet compassionate will evoke many emotions but using “I” statements to express feelings without playing the blame game will better explain the reason behind this difficult decision.
Ending with kindness can make any difficult situation more bearable.
Shelton said it helps to express gratitude for the time shared when the relationship was meaningful.
“If we're focusing on the discomfort from breaking up, we'll continue to feel shame and guilt,” she said.
“Focusing on the growth and lessons learned will help each other move forward in future relationships.”.

Title: Stock futures slide after Trump imposes tariffs | CNN Business
# Stock futures slide after Trump imposes tariffs | CNN Business.
CNN — .
US stock market futures plunged Sunday, one day after President Donald Trump announced 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico and 10% tariffs on China set to go into effect on Tuesday.
Dow futures were down 1.4%, or over 600 points, while S&P 500 futures dropped 1.9%.
The futures traded for tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite were down 2.4% as of 6:36 p.m. ET.
Bitcoin was also down 3.5% over the last 24 hours.
The sharp selloff in the futures market implies the indexes will also open substantially lower when trading kicks off Monday at 9:30 a.m. ET.
Hours after the Trump administration announced the tariffs, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said her country will impose retaliatory tariffs, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced “far-reaching” retaliatory levies.
China's commerce ministry said it will file a complaint with the World Trade Organization and “take corresponding countermeasures,” without elaborating.
“This will include immediate tariffs on $30 billion worth of goods as of Tuesday, followed by further tariffs on $125 billion of American products in 21 days' time, to allow Canadian companies and supply chains to seek to find alternatives,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Saturday.
More than 1,200 goods will be impacted by Canada's immediate tariffs, according to senior government officials on Sunday.
The imposed tariffs would be harmful for states such as Florida, which exports orange juice, fruits and vegetables to Canada, officials said.
Both the Mexican peso and the Canadian dollar weakened relative to the US dollar in the 24 hours since Trump announced the new tariffs, while the Chinese yuan hit a new low.
Economists warned that American families may bear the burden of these tariffs — and Trump posted to his Truth Social account that Americans could face “some pain.”
The tariffs will make groceries more expensive because Mexico and Canada are the main sources of America's imported agricultural goods .
Gas, steel and cars are among other goods expected to be more expensive for American consumers.

Title: Netanyahu blows past ceasefire talks deadline to confer with Trump | CNN
# Netanyahu blows past ceasefire talks deadline to confer with Trump | CNN.
Jerusalem CNN — .
A deadline to begin talks on extending Gaza's ceasefire arrived Monday with the Israeli prime minister in Washington, silence from his office about when a negotiating team might engage with Hamas, and considerable uncertainty about what the next stage of the fragile truce will look like.
The ceasefire, in place for just over two weeks, is set to expire on March 1.
Under the terms of the deal, talks on the next phase are supposed to begin no later than Monday.
But the Israeli government has yet to publicly unveil a negotiating team for the talks, let alone send them to Qatar or Egypt, where Hamas is sending a delegation this week.
Hamas has not publicly commented on Monday's deadline.
Qatar's prime minister, who has acted as an intermediary in the talks, said Sunday that there were “no clear details” on when or how the talks would start.
“We hope to see some movement in the coming days,” Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani said during a press conference in Doha.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has made clear that he sees the path forward not in Doha or Cairo, but in Washington, where he will this week become the first foreign leader to hold a formal meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Netanyahu's office said on the eve of his departure that he had agreed with Trump's Middle East envoy that “negotiations on the second phase of the hostage deal will begin with their meeting in Washington,” during which “they will discuss Israel's positions.”.
Since the ceasefire went into effect on January 19, Hamas and its allies have released 18 hostages held in Gaza.
In exchange, the Israeli government has released 583 Palestinians held in detention - some serving life sentences for serious offenses - but also a significant number of children held without public charge or trial.
The ceasefire has seen the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gazan population centers, a surge of aid entering the enclave and, for the first time since May last year, the opening of the vital Rafah crossing on the border with Egypt for the evacuation of injured and sick Palestinians.
It has also largely held apart from a few violations - only the second respite in 15 months of war, after a brief truce in November 2023.
But the first phase of the truce was only ever meant to last 42 days.
Talks for the second phase must begin Monday, the 16th day of the truce, meaning that Netanyahu is breaching the terms of the deal by talking to Trump first.
Over that second period, CNN understands that the Israeli military would fully withdraw from Gaza and all living hostages, soldier and civilian, would be released in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners.
Chief among Netanyahu's concerns this week will be what Trump wants.
The American president was not yet in office during the first round of ceasefire talks, though his team played a large role in pushing Israel toward a deal.
“Our decisions and the courage of our soldiers have redrawn the map,” Netanyahu said on the tarmac of Ben Gurion Airport Sunday.
“But I believe that, working closely with President Trump, we can redraw it even further and for the better.”.
But Gershon Baskin, a veteran Israeli negotiator and peace activist, said in a statement that Netanyahu's “refusal to begin negotiations on the day stipulated in the agreement is a clear violation of the agreement.”.
“Israel demands that Hamas adhere to all the terms of the agreement, while simultaneously violating it in a significant way.
Once again, Netanyahu is abandoning the hostages and endangering them.”.
Trump claimed credit for the current ceasefire and pledged upon taking office to end foreign wars.
But he has also now repeated his desire for the 2 million people of Gaza to leave so that “we just clean out that whole thing.”
The forced displacement of civilians can constitute “a war crime and/or crime against humanity,” according to the United Nations.
Trump's proposal was music to the ears of the most extreme minister in Netanyahu's governing coalition.
Finance minister Bezalel Smotrich, who vehemently opposed the withdrawal of Israeli forces and settlers from Gaza in 2005, wants Jews to resettle in the enclave.
“Encouraging migration (of Palestinians out of Gaza) is the only solution that will bring peace and security to the residents of Israel and alleviate the suffering of Gaza's Arab residents,” he said after Trump expressed his desire for Palestinians to leave.
Already one minister - the far-right Itamar Ben-Gvir - has withdrawn his party from the Israeli government over the ceasefire, calling it a capitulation.
Smotrich has pledged he will do the same if Israel does not renew the war in Gaza when the current, first phase of the ceasefire expires.

CNN — .
Researchers have detected organic compounds and minerals necessary for life in unprecedented samples collected from the near-Earth asteroid Bennu, adding evidence to the idea that asteroids likely delivered the building blocks of life to our planet early in its history.
The samples are also providing a window into understanding what kind of chemical and biological processes were already underway as space rocks chaotically ricocheted around during the early days of the solar system.
Preliminary analyses of the rock and dust samples released within the past year have shown that the asteroid contained water as well as carbon , nitrogen and other organic matter, but the chemical composition of the organic material was largely unknown.
Now, new research has revealed the asteroid contains many of the chemical building blocks of life, such as amino acids and components found in DNA, said Dr. Daniel P. Glavin, senior scientist for samples return at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.
“This is all very exciting because it suggests that asteroids like Bennu once acted like giant chemical factories in space and could have also delivered the raw ingredients for life to Earth and other bodies in our solar system,” said Glavin, lead author of a study on the samples published Wednesday in the journal Nature Astronomy .
Additionally, the authors of a separate paper published Wednesday in the journal Nature uncovered salts and minerals crucial to life, including some never seen in asteroid samples before, within Bennu's rocks — as well as highlighting the role that ancient water played on the asteroid.
The results of both papers, shared Wednesday during a NASA press conference, present a “groundbreaking scientific discovery,” said Nicky Fox, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate.
“These two papers together go hand in hand to say that Bennu was a much more interesting and complicated place than we probably gave it credit for even six months ago,” said Dr. Tim McCoy, co-lead author of the Nature study and curator of meteorites at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History.
Bennu is a carbon-rich space rock known as a rubble pile asteroid.
Scientists believe Bennu was once part of a larger “parent” asteroid that lost a few pieces due to an impact.
Then, those blasted-off pieces coalesced, like a pile of rocky rubble that is weakly held together by gravity.
The sample was collected from Bennu in October 2020 by a NASA mission called OSIRIS-REx, or Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification and Security-Regolith Explorer.
It marked the first time the US sent a spacecraft to briefly land on an asteroid and collect material.
The OSIRIS-REx spacecraft then dropped off a capsule when it swung by Earth in September 2023, sending it parachuting down into the Utah desert .
A team of researchers worked to carefully retrieve the capsule and ensure that the samples inside remained pristine and completely sealed against any of Earth's atmosphere and environment that could contaminate the extraterrestrial rocks and dust and potentially skew any analysis of its properties.
Scientists were thrilled when they realized that the capsule contained double the expected cache of material, which amounted to about 120 grams, or about the weight of a bar of soap.
Samples were divided up and shared with researchers around the globe.
Glavin and his team detected thousands of organic molecular compounds, including 33 amino acids, in the Bennu samples they studied.
Amino acids, or molecules that combine to form proteins, are some of the building blocks of life.
The researchers found 14 of the 20 amino acids that are used in biology to build proteins, and 19 non-protein amino acids, many of which are rare or nonexistent in known biology, Glavin said.
The team also detected adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymine and uracil — all five of the biological nucleobases, or components that make up the genetic code in DNA and RNA.
“These organic molecules have all been found previously in meteorites, but in contrast to meteorites, the Bennu samples are pristine and were protected from heating during atmospheric entry and exposure to terrestrial contamination,” Glavin said.
“So we have a much higher confidence now that these chemical building blocks of life are in fact extraterrestrial in origin and formed in space, and are not contaminants from Earth.”.
Glavin's team also found compounds rich in nitrogen and ammonia in the samples, suggesting that Bennu was part of a larger asteroid that formed about 4.5 billion years ago in the frigid, distant regions of the solar system.
Ammonia is essential for many biological processes, Glavin said.
Ammonia ice is more stable the farther it is from a heat source, like the sun.
The researchers believe that the ammonia-enriched ice melted inside the large parent asteroid body, estimated to be bigger than 62 miles (100 kilometers) in diameter, creating a liquid environment inside the rock that allowed complex organic molecules, such as the amino acids and nucleobases, to form.
“Having studied meteorites for 35 years, these record the first half billion years of our solar system history that were wiped out by plate tectonics and volcanism and the water cycle here on Earth,” McCoy said.
“I thought we were going to learn about the earliest geologic history of our solar system.
What we ended up finding was a lot of information about the earliest biologic history of our solar system, which is remarkable.”.
McCoy's team, including 66 researchers across four continents, found the salt and minerals left behind as water on Bennu, or its larger parent asteroid, evaporated.
The minerals include sodium phosphates, carbonates, sulfates, chlorides and fluorides, some of which are necessary to the formation of life.
The team was surprised to find the mineral trona, also known as sodium carbonate or soda ash, which has never been directly observed in another asteroid or meteorite.
On Earth, it is used in cleaning products and glass manufacturing.
The researchers believe that pockets or veins of water flowed beneath the surface of Bennu's parent asteroid, which was probably similar to a big ball of mud in the early days of the solar system, McCoy said.
Cracks and fractures in the asteroid allowed water to evaporate to the surface, leaving behind a concentrated brine, or a “soup of the elements,” in its wake.
This concentrated brine, similar to the salty crusts of dry lakebeds on Earth, is where salts and minerals could mingle and create more complex structures, setting the stage for organic compounds to form.
“We now know from Bennu that the raw ingredients of life were combining in really interesting and complex ways on Bennu's parent body,” McCoy said.
“We have discovered that next step on a pathway to life.
But we don't know how far along that pathway this environment could allow things to progress.”.
Brines are of interest to planetary scientists because they could be environments that support the formation of life.
It's also possible that they exist on other worlds in our solar system, including ocean worlds such as Saturn's icy moon Enceladus — which also contains sodium carbonate.
The presence of water, minerals, salts and amino acids suggests it was possible for the building blocks of life to come together in interesting ways on Bennu, but Glavin said more research is required to determine how organic compounds formed and evolved on the space rock.
Many of the minerals have small bits of water trapped in their crystalline structures, so researchers may be able to learn about how the composition of the brine changed over time, which could provide clarity about what took place in the evaporating water, McCoy said.
One of the mysteries presented by the samples is a mixture of amino acids.
Amino acids have handedness, meaning they can be created in two mirror-image versions, like a pair of hands.
On Earth, life produces left-handed amino acids, so Glavin expected to see that reflected in the Bennu samples — but it contains an equal mixture of both, suggesting that amino acids likely began on Earth as both.
Now, Glavin and his colleagues wonder why life on Earth “turned left” rather than right.
The combination of material found in the samples suggests chemical building blocks of life were widespread throughout the solar system, providing strong evidence that the asteroids bombarding early Earth may have delivered water and organic material to its surface, Glavin noted.
But that theory raises the question of whether this life-delivering bombardment ever successfully occurred on any other planet in the solar system, McCoy said.
And there is also the puzzle of why life didn't form inside Bennu itself, given that most of the raw ingredients needed were present, Glavin said.
“Maybe it was because there just wasn't enough time to do the more complex organic chemistry need for life before the salty liquids evaporated in the parent body,” Glavin said.
“Future missions to other bodies in our solar system will be critical to seek the answers about how life began on Earth and our search for life elsewhere.”.

Title: TikTok's parent company is in active discussions about a deal, board member says | CNN Business
# TikTok's parent company is in active discussions about a deal, board member says | CNN Business.
New York CNN — .
A board member at TikTok's parent company said that a deal to save the app from disappearing in the United States will be done soon.
General Atlantic CEO Bill Ford, a ByteDance board member, said Wednesday that it's in “everyone's interest” to keep the app active.
Ford made the remarks at an Axios-sponsored event in Davos, Switzerland.
“We'll get on with it, as soon as maybe the end of the week in terms of negotiating what might work…
The Chinese government, the US government and the company and the board all have to be involved in this conversation,” Ford said, adding that there could be solutions “short of divestiture.
” General Atlantic is a major investor in TikTok-owner ByteDance.
One of President Donald Trump's first acts after taking office Monday was signing an executive action that delays enforcement of the TikTok ban for 75 days.
The action directs the US Justice Department not to enforce the Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which passed with broad bipartisan support in Congress and was signed in April by former President Joe Biden.
The law required that starting January 19, TikTok be banned in the US unless it sells to a buyer from America or one of its allies.
Trump told reporters that he would be open to the sale of only a 50% stake , and that he changed his mind on TikTok because he “got to use it.” .
Trump is also talking about TikTok as a deal-making exercise, saying Tuesday that “I have the right to make a deal” and rhetorically repositioning the US law banning TikTok as a big business opportunity for the US and his tech mogul friends.
Trump added that said he would be open to X owner Elon Musk or Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison taking over the app.
Investor groups led by billionaire Frank McCourt and YouTuber and TikTok star Jimmy Donaldson, also known as MrBeast , also have made bids for TikTok for undisclosed sums.
For now, TikTok's ultimate fate in America remains in doubt until a deal is made.
It's unclear that ByteDance would want to sell, even if it were a deal brokered by Trump.

Title: French AI chatbot taken offline after wild answers led to online ridicule | CNN Business
# French AI chatbot taken offline after wild answers led to online ridicule | CNN Business.
CNN — .
A French-language artificial intelligence chatbot backed by the French government has been taken offline after providing nonsensical answers to simple mathematical equations, and even recommending that one user eat cow's eggs.
In a statement Saturday, the Linagora Group, a company that is part of a consortium developing the model, named Lucie, said it remains an “academic research project in its early stages.”.
Lucie was released “prematurely,” said Linagora, adding that it should have been clearer in informing users of the limitations of the model in its current form.
“We were carried away by our own enthusiasm,” the statement reads.
Michel-Marie Maudet, general director of Linagora Group, told CNN that the team would now update its model and then test a beta version in private before a public relaunch.
After Lucie was launched Thursday, users took to social media to share its erroneous answers, including a response to a user query asking the chatbot to tell them about cow's eggs.
“Cow's eggs, also known as chicken's eggs, are edible eggs produced by cows,” Lucie was quoted as replying.
“Cow's eggs are a source of protein and nutrients, and are considered to be a healthy and nutritious food.”.
Asked to multiply 5 by (3+2), the model gave an answer of 17, instead of 25, and Lucie also said that “the square root of a goat is one,” users reported.
Launched with ambitions of challenging the dominance of the English language in AI and providing an alternative to models such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Lucie is named after the oldest human ancestor, said Linagora.
Its logo is inspired by both Marianne, a national symbol of France, and the US actress Scarlett Johansson, who starred in the film “Lucy,” according to a statement from Linagora published on January 3.
“Lucie is covered by a blue, white and red shawl, demonstrating her sovereign French personality,” the statement added.
Lucie has been backed by French President Emmanuel Macron as part of his France 2030 investment program, which includes a wide range of projects worth a total of €54 billion ($56.8 billion)..
And Macron is currently preparing to host the Artificial Intelligence Action Summit, which will bring world leaders and tech figures to Paris from February 10 to 11.

Title: The Fed's go-to inflation gauge heated up again | CNN Business
# The Fed's go-to inflation gauge heated up again | CNN Business.
CNN — .
The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge moved even higher in December, driven largely by rising energy prices as well as food.
However, a closely watched measurement of underlying inflation trends indicated some progress in the fight to rein in price hikes.
The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index rose 2.6% in December from the year before, heating up from November's 2.4% increase , according to new Commerce Department data released Friday.
On a monthly basis, prices rose 0.3% as compared to 0.1% in November.
That acceleration was in line with economists' expectations, which called for a 0.3% increase from November and a 2.6% annual gain, according to FactSet consensus estimates.
The core PCE price index, which excludes the more volatile components of gas and food, hit expectations on the nose: It rose 0.2% from November and the annual rate of underlying inflation held pat at 2.8% for the third month in a row, according to the report.
Inflation has cooled substantially since peaking in the summer of 2022, and that progress continued through 2024 to the point where an elusive “soft landing”— price stability without having the economy tank into a recession — remained achievable as Joe Biden wrapped up his presidency.
The PCE price index is part of the Commerce Department's monthly Personal Income and Outlays report, which includes comprehensive data on how Americans earn, spend and save.
And in December, they ramped up their spending significantly.
Consumer spending shot up 0.7% from November, exceeding economists' expectations for a 0.5% gain.
With Thanksgiving landing late in November, the holiday shopping season was largely concentrated in December ; also, the increase likely reflected some replacement purchases of cars, furniture and other goods damaged by the two major hurricanes that hit in October 2024, Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon, told CNN Friday.
Another likely factor is that consumers also were buying more durable goods in anticipation of tariffs that have been threatened by President Donald Trump, Samuel Tombs, Pantheon Macroeconomics' chief US economist, wrote in a note to clients on Friday.
Purchases of TVs, technology products and autos have notably surged, he noted.
Trump on Thursday reiterated plans to slap a 25% tariff on imports from both Canada and Mexico.
“Consumers shop with an eye on bargains, and 25% tariffs of the imports of America's two largest trading partners could force prices of store-bought goods well beyond the reach of many if not all consumers,” economist Chris Rupkey of FwdBonds wrote in commentary on Friday.
“There may not be another full-blown cost of living crisis, but the future with tariffs certainly looks less affordable for all Americans.”.
“We are not sure the country is willing to pay the price for the new administration's social goals of stopping migrants and illicit drugs at the border,” he added.
The sheer rate of spending does not appear to be sustainable, Pantheon's Tombs noted.
Households' personal saving rate — savings as a percentage after tax — was the lowest in two years, Commerce Department data shows.
The saving rate dropped to 3.8% from 4.1% in November, according to Friday's report.
“It now is 2 percentage points below its 2015-to-19 average,” Tombs said.
Consumers also are leaning more on their credit cards.
The share of people making just the minimum payment on their credit cards hit a 12-year high, according to third-quarter 2024 data released last week by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.
“It's an orange flag,” EY-Parthenon's Daco told CNN.
“We're noticing that there is a bifurcation in the consumer outlook in that the consumers at the lower-to-medium end of the income spectrum are spending more judiciously in a high-price, high-interest-rate environment.”.
The strong momentum seen in the consumer spending data has largely been driven by higher income individuals, he said.
Overall, personal income grew 0.4% in December, marking a slight acceleration from the 0.3% gain seen the month before, according to Friday's report.
“The monthly numbers add some more light on the income side of the economy,” Eugenio Alemán, chief economist at Raymond James, wrote Friday.
“This showed that consumers are deploying their savings to 'keep up with the Joneses,' which could become a problem down the line.”.
Friday's release marked the final inflation report for 2024, and while the last chapter showed a “bump in the road” during the fourth quarter, the underlying fundamentals remain disinflationary, Daco said.
That story should continue through the first couple of months of this year, he said, noting disinflationary dynamics like cautious consumer spending, constrained pricing power, strong productivity growth, easing shelter cost inflation, slowing insurance-related inflation and cooling wage growth. (Separately, on Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that workers' compensation grew 3.8% for the year ended in December, slowing from a 3.9% rate notched in September.) .
However, he added, the inflationary risks are much higher than they were before the election, he added.
“As we look further out, then you might start to see the pressures from some of the policies that are put in place — immigration restrictions; perhaps even some deregulation; and tariffs, of course, are big, big unknowns,” he said.
“But their effect on the economy is likely to take a bit more time.”.
The path to the Fed's 2% inflation target was expected to be long and bumpy, and it has been a little choppy the past couple of months, prompting the central bank to take a more cautious approach to rate cuts in 2025.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that inflation remains elevated; but the labor market is solid, and the economy is strong, so the central bank doesn't have to hurry more rate cuts.
He also indicated policymakers are taking a wait-and-see approach as some of Trump's sweeping policy moves come to fruition.

Title: Early signs of dementia can show in your finances | CNN Business
# Early signs of dementia can show in your finances | CNN Business.
New York CNN — .
Financial files in disarray.
Late payments and last-warning service-cutoff notices.
Multiple daily bank withdrawals.
Out-of-character purchases.
When a family member who has been fairly responsible with money all their lives becomes careless with their finances, it may be one sign of as-yet-undiagnosed dementia .
Researchers at the New York Federal Reserve who analyzed both US credit reporting and Medicare data found that in the five years before a dementia diagnosis, a person's average credit scores may start to weaken and their payment delinquencies rise.
“The harmful financial effects of undiagnosed memory disorders exacerbate the already substantial financial pressure households face upon diagnosis,” the researchers wrote.
“Beyond susceptibility to payment delinquency, early stage [Alzheimer's disease and related disorders] may affect new account openings and debt accumulation, credit utilization, and/or credit mix.”.
Their findings echo the results of a 2020 study from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health .
Marcey Tidwell, who lives in Bloomington, Indiana, said those findings are “not remotely shocking.”
Tidwell's mother was diagnosed with a form of dementia in 2020 and has been living with her daughter ever since.
Tidwell said that for most of her life, her mother was an “outrageously methodical human being” who kept the bills paid and the family records organized across many moves as her husband pursued a career in the military.
After going through her mother's papers this year, Tidwell surmises that her mother's memory started faltering around 2015, because from that point forward her record-keeping became “less than pristine.”.
For example, Tidwell said, her mom used to keep an immaculate record of checks written and deposits and withdrawals made in her checkbook register.
But that register became a mess.
“There was a bunch of stuff scratched out and she was obsessively adding and re-adding — she knew things weren't all they could be.
Later on, I saw that she took out large amounts of her savings, more than she needed for groceries.”.
Karen Lemay, who lives in Ottawa, Canada, knew something was really wrong with her father in 2022 when she saw on his desk piles of late-payment notices and final-notification warnings from service providers and insurers.
Her father was a former finance executive who “was very conservative with his money, very smart about it and never reckless with it,” she said.
And he had strongly impressed upon his daughter the importance of paying off her credit card in full every month to avoid interest.
Yet Lemay discovered he owed $50,000 in charges, interest and late payment fees on a Visa card.
He also financed the purchase of a new car he didn't need, just months before police took away his driver's license.
Normally, he would only buy high-end used cars with cash, she said.
What's more, his daughter noted, he failed to pay his 2021 taxes.
So he ended up owing the government roughly $20,000, the bulk of which was for late payment and underpayment penalties.
“I spoke to him about some of his balances and he refused to believe he hadn't paid them,” Lemay said.
Jayne Sibley, who lives in the United Kingdom, knows the pain and stress of dealing with the financial behaviors that can signal dementia.
Her father and mother were both diagnosed with different forms of it.
Her father moved into a nursing home years ago, but her now-deceased mother remained in her own home, albeit with live-in care.
“The most challenging thing we faced was managing mum's everyday money as her condition progressed.
She would overspend on things she didn't need or want.
Random items, cleaning equipment, luxury food.
She also fell victim to scams over the phone — a fake insurance policy, those sorts of things,” Sibley said.
Her mother also would take money out of the cash machine two to three times a day and give it to anyone who asked.
Acutely aware of how high long-term care costs were, given her father's situation, Sibley said she worried that her mother would run through the money that would be needed for her own care.
While her mother's condition made her vulnerable with money, she initially was still able to walk and shop and go to yoga on her own.
In other words, she was able to maintain a lot of her autonomy and social ties.
To try to stem the money outflow, Sibley and her brother tried doling out a week's worth of cash for their mother “but she'd spend it all in one go,” she said.
Ditto when they tried divvying the cash up into daily envelopes.
Eventually, they took away her cash card.
But, soon after, her condition worsened, Sibley said.
“She wasn't able to maintain her familiar routines and social connections.
That's when we realized there has to be a better way.”.
With her husband, she founded Sibstar , which offers a debit card in the UK that can be used by a person with dementia to maintain some sense of financial autonomy and social engagement.
When needed, family caregivers can monitor their debit transactions via an app.
As a person's condition worsens, the caregiver can set limits on how much money can be spent on any given day or week, and where the card can be used (eg, at cash machines, online or at the grocery store). .
While there are few dementia-specific financial tools to reduce the odds that someone squanders their own hard-earned money, there are steps you can take to make it easier to assume control over another person's finances when they become incapacitated.
In 2008, a year after her father died without a will and a dozen years before her mother was diagnosed with dementia, Tidwell said she and her siblings took their mother to a lawyer to make sure she had a will, named her medical proxy and named the person to whom she would give power of attorney to handle her financial affairs should the need arise.
That made it easier for Tidwell, among other things, to get online access in 2018 to her mother's bank account to make sure nothing was amiss.
By 2020, she had automated her mother's bill paying online.
“The time to make plans is before you need to.
It's hard to overstate what a gift that trip to the lawyer in 2008 was to 'future me,'
” said Tidwell, who fully manages her mother's finances now that her condition has worsened considerably.
Since dementia can worsen over time and because someone in the initial stages may not recognize they are more vulnerable to financial errors and scams, the US National Institute on Aging recommends that a family take steps early on to alleviate those concerns, such as setting up automated bill payments for the person with dementia.
Of course, no amount of advanced financial planning can alleviate the heartbreak of watching a loved one with dementia decline.
“I prepared as best as I could, but it's still hard,” Tidwell said.
That's why she advises anyone potentially facing a similar situation to, in her words, “make the easy part easy.” .

Title: Costco and Teamsters reach a tentative deal to avert a strike | CNN Business
# Costco and Teamsters reach a tentative deal to avert a strike | CNN Business.
New York CNN — .
A threatened strike at 56 Costco stores across six states has been averted for now, as the company and negotiators for the Teamsters union, representing 18,000 workers, reached an 11th hour tentative agreement, the union told CNN early Saturday morning.
Full terms of the deal were not immediately available.
Costco did not respond a request for comment.
The strike would have been the largest ever at an American retail chain, and the first ever at the big box retailer.
Beyond wages and benefits, the union also had demands regarding seniority pay, paid family leave, bereavement policies, sick time, and safeguards against surveillance.
The agreement, announced several hours after the contract expired at 11:59pm PT Friday, does not completely end the threat of a strike.
It would still need to be ratified by rank-and-file members of the union at Costco before it goes into effect.
Last fall, unionized workers at Boeing voted down a tentative deal its union leadership had reached with the aircraft maker and started a strike that lasted two months.
But most tentative deals do result in a final contract.
Teamsters members at Costco make up 8% of its 219,000 employees at 616 US stores, according to company filings.
But a strike by that many workers would behave been significant for the largely non-union sector of the economy.
Labor Department statistics show that less than 5% of retail workers are represented by unions.
Most of those unionized retail workers work in grocery stores.
The specific locations of the unionized stores have not been identified by either the union or company.
But the union said they are in six states along the East and West Coasts - Maryland, New Jersey, New York and Virginia as well as California and Washington state, the latter being Costco's corporate home.
Costco had said on Friday that even if its unionized workers had gone on strike, “all of our locations will be open for business this weekend,” an indication that it intended to use management and non-union staff to keep stores operating.
And even though the Teamsters only represent workers at a small fraction of Costco stores overall, it was prepared to set up picket lines at an undisclosed number of non-union Costco stores nationwide, even if workers at those stores remained on the job.
Such a move could have greatly increased the economic pressure on the company.
While there are only 18,000 Teamsters at Costco, the union has more than 1 million US members it can call on for other picket lines.
Costco has a reputation for providing relatively good pay and benefits, especially compared to other retail chains.
Its annual company filing states that “our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits.
Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover, increasing productivity and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average.”.
Costco confirmed a Reuters report that it recently sent a letter out to all employees at non-union stores announcing it was raising pay by a dollar an hour, to $30.20 this year and another dollar an hour each of the next two years.
Starting pay would be raised by 50 cents an hour to $20..
The Teamsters have pointed to Costco's strong financial results as an argument for an improved wage and benefits package.
Costco reported record annual net income in the most recent fiscal year of $7.4 billion — up 17% from a year earlier and nearly double what it earned in 2019 ahead of the Covid-19 pandemic.
At a recent union rally held outside Costco's annual meeting, union members held banners reading: “Pro worker?
Prove it!
” and “Record profits = record contract.”.
Last year, the Teamsters staged a five-day strike at Amazon that ended the day after Christmas.
But unlike the situation at Costco, Amazon does not recognize the union as representing any of its workers and has refused to negotiate, let alone agree to terms on a contract.
Amazon doesn't even recognize that many of the strikers, who are officially drivers for third-party delivery services despite exclusively delivering packages for the online retailer, are its employees.
This is a developing story.
It will be updated.

Title: Arab nations reject Trump's call to relocate Gazans to neighboring countries | CNN
# Arab nations reject Trump's call to relocate Gazans to neighboring countries | CNN.
CNN — .
A key group of Arab nations have said they “firmly” reject any efforts to resettle or evict Palestinians from Gaza, after US President Donald Trump said he wanted to “clean out” the enclave and move its population to neighboring countries.
The foreign ministers of Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt issued a wide-ranging statement Saturday, saying they hoped to work with Trump on a two-state solution in the Middle East.
But they pushed back on Trump's suggestion to relocate Palestinians from Gaza.
Without specifically referencing the president's proposal, the ministers reiterated a commitment to rebuilding the enclave while ensuring “the continued presence of Palestinians in their homeland.” .
The nations “firmly rejected any actions that threaten these rights, including settlement expansion, forced evictions, home demolitions, land annexation, or the displacement of Palestinians through direct expulsion or coerced migration,” they wrote after a meeting of the foreign ministers in Cairo.
In January, Trump said he had spoken with the king of Jordan about potentially building housing elsewhere in the Middle East and moving more than 1 million Palestinians from Gaza to neighboring countries.
“I said to him that I'd love you to take on more, because I'm looking at the whole Gaza Strip right now and it's a mess, it's a real mess,” he told reporters aboard Air Force One.
“You're talking about a million and a half people, and we just clean out that whole thing.”.
“I don't know, something has to happen, but it's literally a demolition site right now,” Trump said.
“Almost everything's demolished, and people are dying there, so I'd rather get involved with some of the Arab nations and build housing in a different location where I think they could maybe live in peace for a change.”.
The statement from the Arab foreign ministers touched on a range of topics relating to Gaza's reconstruction, as the fragile ceasefire between Hamas and Israel allows the region to assess the impact of a brutal 15-month conflict.
The group hailed “the important role played by the United States in facilitating the deal,” for which both Trump and his predecessor Joe Biden have sought credit.
They also “called for the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and rejected any attempts to partition the Strip,” and pointed to the “indispensable role” of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees or UNRWA, two days after Israel's ban on the agency went into effect.

Title: Trump DOJ appointee in DC lashes out after flurry of 'personally insulting' leaks in his first week | CNN Politics
# Trump DOJ appointee in DC lashes out after flurry of 'personally insulting' leaks in his first week | CNN Politics.
CNN — .
The acting top federal prosecutor in Washington under President Donald Trump is furious about recent leaks to the press and also specifically directed staff to scrutinize a former official's work on January 6 cases after she rebuked him on TV, according to internal emails obtained by CNN.
Ed Martin, the interim US attorney for DC, sent an email Tuesday to his entire office, complaining that someone leaked an email he sent Monday.
In the Monday email, he launched an internal review of how prosecutors handled some January 6, 2021, cases where the Supreme Court concluded that prosecutors overstepped with charging decisions.
In the Tuesday email blast, Martin said: “Wow, what a disappointment to have my email yesterday to you all was leaked almost immediately.
Again, personally insulting and professionally unacceptable.
I guess I have learned my lesson ('Fool me once…').”.
The latest missive from Martin highlights his turbulent first week, as he aggressively tries to impose Trump's agenda at the Justice Department, while facing pushback both internally from career prosecutors and others who quit and then bashed his actions.
Martin is a socially conservative activist and commentator and was involved with the 2020 election denier movement.
In his Tuesday email, he lashed out at a prosecutor who was involved in January 6 cases and resigned after Trump granted mass clemency that ended all of the nearly 1,600 cases and wiped away all remaining prison terms.
That ex-prosecutor, Ashley Akers, gave at least four TV interviews Monday, with multiple appearances on MSNBC and CNN , where she condemned many of Martin's moves.
Akers said she had a “guttural reaction” when Trump chose to “immediately absolve” the January 6 defendants.
She said it was “appalling” that Martin was “advocating on behalf of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers” by successfully urging a judge to nix their travel restrictions .
And she called his internal review of January 6 cases a “wild goose chase.” .
In response, Martin sent an officewide email Tuesday rebuking Akers for “going on television badmouthing our work (and me!).”
He said, “we will need to make sure we have her records and emails,” including for his review of January 6 prosecutions. (Akers' name was misspelled in the email.).
“I have never met her so I find her comments disconnected from reality - not a credit to our office,” Martin wrote in the email.
“She mentioned 'fear' (and used the word 'guttural') - I am not sure to what she is referring …
I will be reaching out to her.
Maybe she had issues with her supervisors or my predecessor.
We will see if we can help her.”.
Akers declined to comment about Martin's emails.
A spokesperson for the US attorney's office didn't respond to a request for comment.
In a separate email last week that was also obtained by CNN, Martin said he had a “great” first day in the office, but was dismayed that someone leaked details about a conversation they had.
In many of his emails, Martin has complained about these leaks.
“Unfortunately, immediately after our 'get to know you' meetings, one of the attendees leaked to the press about a specific detail,” Martin wrote in the officewide email that CNN obtained.
“This is personally insulting, of course, and professionally unacceptable.
If you are the person or person who leaked, feel free to contact me directly.”.

Title: Federal agents in immigration operations told to be camera-ready as hundreds arrested | CNN Politics
# Federal agents in immigration operations told to be camera-ready as hundreds arrested | CNN Politics.
CNN — .
The Trump administration's immigration sweeps that included more than 2,000 arrests in two days and have chilled many immigrant communities were followed by another blitz: A barrage of video and photos from the federal government showing agents in tactical gear and vests emblazoned with “Police ICE” and “Homeland Security” taking cuffed suspects away.
The made-for-TV look of the arrests is not a coincidence.
At least two agencies assisting US immigration officials with the sweeps ordered by the fledgling Republican White House have told personnel to ensure their clothing clearly depicts their respective agency in case they are filmed by journalists, sources familiar with the operations tell CNN.
While it is a common safety practice for agents conducting arrests to wear insignias clearly identifying themselves as law enforcement, even agents on the perimeter of operations conducted across the nation have been specifically instructed by their leadership to wear raid jackets in view of media attention, sources said.
On Sunday, federal agencies released numerous photos on social media of agents in tactical gear conducting purported immigration arrests.
TV talk show host Dr. Phil McGraw announced on social media he was “embedded” with an Immigration and Customs Enforcement team in Chicago as operations began.
McGraw released video showing him interviewing the Trump administration's new “border czar,” Tom Homan, at what was described as an ICE command center.
Inviting a celebrity guest to the Chicago operations was frustrating to Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul, a Democrat, who told CNN's Jim Acosta his office has not received any notice about the arrests despite working with federal law enforcement in the past.
“I think it's done for the show, and I think it's done to upset community and to score political points with those who want to divide,” said Raoul.
Democratic US Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois said his offices would help anyone who was improperly arrested.
“We can all agree we that must remove dangerous individuals who are here illegally,” Durbin wrote in a post on X .
“But the actions being taken by the Trump admin go beyond those goals.” .
In addition to Chicago, immigration actions were reported in California, Texas, Georgia, Ohio, Michigan, Colorado, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, according to Homeland Security and the Drug Enforcement Administration.
“We're prioritizing criminal aliens,” Homan told CNN on Sunday, but added, “There's going to be a point where we have to open the aperture to fugitives.”.
## Arrests reported at homes and a church .
Arrests of undocumented immigrants, including those with no criminal record, have been reported across the country.
Jennifer Jimenez, whose cousin was detained by federal agents in Newark, New Jersey, last week, said her cousin was not in the United States to “create any harm” — he just wanted to provide for his family.
Jimenez told CNN's Erin Burnett on Monday her cousin David is a “hard-working man” and does not have a criminal record.
He has been in the United States for about four years, she said.
Federal agents detained multiple people Thursday during what ICE called “a targeted enforcement operation.”
Jimenez described agents coming into the business where her cousin worked and asking for his identification before they took him to a detention center.
The agents “raided” the local business and detained “undocumented residents as well as citizens, without producing a warrant,” Newark Mayor Ras Baraka said in a statement at the time.
Jimenez said her cousin came to the United States to take care of his family and pay medical bills.
His younger sister died of cancer and had a young daughter, whom he was raising, Jimenez said.
Federal agents “don't know the reason that they're coming here,” Jimenez said of immigrants.
“It's not for them to create any harm.
It's for them to prosper, to keep their family alive.”.
The enforcement action was in response to a tip reporting unauthorized workers at a place of business, a law enforcement source briefed on the investigation in Newark told CNN.
A suburban Chicago woman said her father — a native of Mexico — had been living in the Unites States for nearly 30 years when he was arrested Sunday after agents knocked on his door.
“They would open the door because they thought maybe one of (his children) were in trouble or something happened to us,” Yelitza Marquina told CNN affiliate WLS .
“Never did he think they were ICE.” .
One undocumented man was taken into custody by ICE while attending church Sunday in Tucker, Georgia, his pastor told CNN.
Luis Ortiz was in the middle of his sermon when he saw the man being escorted out by other congregants.
He was told ICE agents did not enter the building but asked for the man by name.
Former acting director of ICE under the Obama administration, John Sandweg, told CNN's Laura Coates that, under Trump's new policy, more “collateral arrests” are being made.
“When you go to a home where you've identified one of your primary target lives, oftentimes you find they're not the only undocumented immigrant living in the home.
They might have family members who are undocumented,” Sandweg said.
“In the Biden administration or Obama administration, you don't take those people into custody unless they also pose a threat to public safety,” Sandweg said.
“Under the Trump administration, they've been very open about arresting everybody in the house.
That does drive up the number of arrests.”.
Adult migrants have stopped going to work and children are not going to school out of fear they could be arrested at any time, a Chicago-based non-profit assisting immigrants told CNN.
The charity asked not to be named because of fear of retaliation.
In the Atlanta area, the DeKalb County School District sent a note to school families advising them the district will not voluntarily allow immigration agents into their schools.
“As with any unauthorized visitor, entrance beyond the main office and access to students or their information is prohibited without a court order or exigent circumstances,” wrote Superintendent Devon Horton.
A coalition of Quaker groups filed a lawsuit in Maryland on Monday to stop the Department of Homeland Security from enacting its new policy of allowing immigration enforcement near places of worship.
The lawsuit asks the court to declare as unconstitutional the newly created policy by the Trump administration to conduct immigration enforcement near or at houses of worship, dictated by an individual agent's “common sense.”
The lawsuit says religious exercise is an essential service, and preventing congregants from attending services creates “a substantial burden” on the plaintiff's own rights.
Nationwide, 1,179 people were arrested Monday and 853 immigration detainers were lodged, ICE said in a post on X. This comes after 956 people were arrested and 554 detainers were lodged Sunday, ICE said in a post on X , marking the highest numbers since the agency started reporting them on the platform.
ICE will continue “enhanced operations” across the Southeast about two to three times a week, according to a source with knowledge of the operations.
They will involve the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, with the agencies given authority to apprehend immigrants .
ICE is casting a wide net, but its primary target is Tren de Aragua , a transnational criminal gang that originated in a Venezuelan prison, according to the source.
Not all communities with large immigrant communities appear to be concerned by the sweeps.
“Most of my constituents are fine.
My constituents are here legally,” said US Rep. Carlos Giménez, a Republican who represents a portion of Miami-Dade County, Florida.
Trump defeated Kamala Harris in that county, with its large Cuban population, by more than 125,000 votes in 2024.
“That's what President Trump ran on, and he is complying with his promises,” Giménez told CNN's Pamela Brown.
Chicago and several other “sanctuary cities” are also the subject of a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee investigation announced Monday.
House Committee Chairman James Comer, a Republican from Kentucky, sent letters to the mayors of Boston, Chicago, Denver and New York and requested documents and information related to those cities' policies.
Sanctuary jurisdiction is a term broadly applied to cities that have policies to limit cooperation with or involvement in federal immigration enforcement actions.
In response to the investigation, a spokesperson for the city of Boston said, “We are proud that Boston is the safest major city in the United States.
We have received the letter and are reviewing it.”.
Denver Mayor Mike Johnston said in a statement, “The most helpful thing Congressional Republicans could do right now is fix our broken immigration system.
While they work on that, we will focus on running the cities that manage the consequences of their failure to act.”.
And a spokesperson for New York Mayor Eric Adams told CNN he “has made clear that New York City is committed to working with our federal partners to fix our broken immigration system and focus on the small number of people who are entering our localities and committing violent crimes.
We will review the letter and respond accordingly.”.
CNN has reached out to the office of Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson.
ICE agents are “actually very good” at identifying people when they are booked into jail and putting a detainer on them, Sanweg explained.
“But sometimes people get out,” he said.
“And then, to be fair - with some of the administration's rhetoric in a sanctuary city - they are less likely to give ICE agents access to the jails.
So that increases the number of targets out on the street … that's the primary tactic for the targeting piece of this.
Pressed by CNN's Kaitlan Collins on the administration's departure from long-standing policy by allowing federal immigration agents to conduct arrests at churches and schools, Homan said: “There's no safe haven for public safety.” .
“Again, it takes a lot to get approval to go into a school or church.
But if there's a national security threat, we're going,” he said.
Local authorities in several cities have highlighted their policies of not participating in federal immigration raids since the Trump administration launched its immigration crackdown.
The Chicago Police Department said in a statement to CNN it does not document immigration status, and in accordance with its “Welcoming City Ordinance,”
“does not share information with federal immigration authorities.”.
In San Jose, California, “we do not have our local police officers engaged in the enforcement actions that are primarily related to somebody's status or enforcing an immigration law,” Mayor Matt Mahan told CNN's Erin Burnett on Monday.
And in Sunnyside, a city in central Washington where city manager Mike Gonzalez said the vast majority of residents are Latino, local police and authorities will not participate in federal immigration efforts, he said after several arrests were reported there.
After the arrest of 20 people at a local business near Cleveland, Ohio, Cleveland Heights city officials said in a statement that they “did not have prior knowledge of, was not involved in, nor did it cooperate or coordinate with federal officials from ICE in a raid,” according to CNN affiliate WOIO .
Alternately, in Nassau County, a suburb of New York on Long Island with a significant migrant community, local law enforcement have said they're ready and willing to help federal immigration efforts.
“Nassau County Police and Sheriff Departments are fully cooperating with ICE and other federal agencies to round up illegal migrants starting with the worst first,” Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, a Republican, told CNN in a statement Monday.
Teams across the country have been given various quotas for the number of so-called “high-profile” immigration sweeps they should conduct each month, one source said, with the goal being to beat the number of administrative arrests made by Immigration and Customs Enforcement last year.
ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations conducted 113,431 administrative arrests in the fiscal year that ended October 2024, according to an agency report .
That's about 310 arrests a day.
Homan denied imposing an arrest quota on ICE officers.
“I don't have a number.
As many as we can arrest and deport,” he told Collins. “
The more money we have, the more we can do.”.
Whether there is a firm arrest quota or not, Sandweg said he's concerned the pressure to rack up large arrest numbers could result in heavy-handed tactics.
“What I'm very interested to see is in the next few weeks as these target lists get exhausted — as they just run out of the easy pickings of the people connected to the criminal justice system — what operational tactics are they going to utilize that feed the machinery that the Trump administration has built?” he said.
About 11 million undocumented immigrants live in the United States, the Pew Research Center's latest estimates indicate.
Federal law enforcement agencies have been told to prioritize deporting a wide swath of criminal suspects under investigation who may be “out of status,” a law enforcement source familiar with the latest operations tells CNN.
Someone who is out of status may have entered the United States legally but has violated the terms of their visa or other immigration requirements.
If a suspect under investigation by agencies such as the FBI, ATF or DEA is in the country unlawfully, and an indictment for non-immigration criminal offenses investigated by those agencies is not likely in the near term, the source said, investigators have been told to consider “just getting them out.”.
The new posture is notable because crimes investigated by federal law enforcement agencies can take weeks or even several months to prove and prosecute.
However, under the new guidance from Trump administration officials, agencies have been told to opt for deportation of undocumented suspects if a criminal indictment does not appear on the horizon.
Prior to taking office, Trump transition officials were asking law enforcement agencies about how many of their investigations involved non-US citizens, the source said.
CNN's Michelle Krupa, Lauren Mascarenhas, Gustavo Valdés, Zoe Sottile and Karina Tsui contributed to this report.

Title: Fear of flying: How to manage it | CNN
# Fear of flying: How to manage it | CNN.
Sign up for CNN's Stress, But Less newsletter.
Our six-part mindfulness guide will inform and inspire you to reduce stress while learning how to harness it . .
CNN — .
When air travel accidents such as the fatal midair collision near Washington, DC, occur, the consequences can reach much further than those directly affected by the tragedy.
It can also give rise or increase people's fear of flying, also known as aerophobia or aviophobia.
Many people have sat through plane delays due to mechanical issues, weather or other reasons, perhaps a bit concerned at the holdup but not terrified of what could happen.
“Almost every person has had some thought of, 'Oh, my plane is delayed.
I hope everything's safe and fine,'” said Dr. Gail Saltz, clinical associate professor of psychiatry at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City.
But it's not that simple for everyone.
“Some people have a tendency to have a thought become what's called sticky or obsessive,” Saltz added.
“They don't like the thought, but it sticks in their mind, and they can't really get it out.
This kind of event is a typical trigger for people to have some increase in anxiety about flying or a true aerophobia.” .
As one of the most common phobias, aerophobia affects more than 25 million adults in the United States, according to the Cleveland Clinic .
It most commonly affects people between ages 17 and 34 — “a time in life when significant changes occur, such as graduation, marriage or childbirth,” the clinic website notes.
“People may be scared that flying jeopardizes their life at such an important time.” .
In light of Wednesday night's tragic collision, Saltz discussed aerophobia's symptoms and how people can manage the phobia to help themselves recover rather than limit their lives. .
This conversation has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.
CNN: What's the difference between flight anxiety and a flying phobia? .
Dr. Gail Saltz: Flight anxiety is just anxiety about flying.
But diagnostically, there is a definition of aerophobia, and people with it have sets of symptoms.
There are physical symptoms of that fear — fast heartbeat, sweating, trembling, dizziness, nausea, shortness of breath, chest pain or vomiting.
They have emotional symptoms, so they feel panicky and worried.
There might be behavioral symptoms that make someone cancel a flight at the last minute because of their panic or decide to take a train for an obscene number of hours to avoid flying.
They might choose to not go on vacations or business trips and repeatedly seek reassurance about travel safety from other people.
Those symptoms can occur even the week before the flight or at any point when they're on the plane.
For flight anxiety to be considered a flying phobia, these symptoms need to have been the case for six months or more.
It needs to be interfering with their life in some way.
People who seek treatment usually have a debilitating phobia.
CNN: What causes aerophobia? .
Saltz: There's not one thing that causes any phobia, including fear of flying.
But you're more likely to experience aerophobia if you already have high anxiety .
Another factor is trauma, like a natural disaster experience or a terrible car accident — something where your life felt at risk.
Kids who have a parent with a fear of flying can acquire it from them.
CNN: What factors may worry someone with aerophobia? .
Saltz: Sometimes it's not even the flying per se.
Sometimes it's a fear of being in an enclosed thing in the air and not being able to get out.
It could be a fear of heights, of becoming motion sick and vomiting, of contagious illness or of takeoff, landing, thunderstorms or turbulence.
Everybody thinks that you're terrified that the plane will crash, but that's only a small number of flying phobias.
CNN: What ways of coping with aerophobia are unhelpful? .
Saltz: When you avoid or cancel a flight, you feel this great sense of relief.
That relief provides positive reinforcement to your brain, saying, “This was a good thing.
I avoided the danger.
I feel better now.” .
However, your world just shrunk a little smaller, and your fear, being reinforced by this, gets larger.
The one thing you don't want to do is avoid, and as hard as that is, it will help you diminish your fear.
Also, avoid drinking or taking sleeping pills or other drugs (to deal with your phobia) unless prescribed by a doctor.
That can be dangerous and cause dependence, and it won't give you the therapeutic benefit of exposing yourself to the flight and moving in the direction of recovery.
CNN: How can someone manage or overcome a fear of flying? .
Saltz: Phobias in general are one of the most common mental health conditions, and they're very treatable.
The treatment is exposure and response prevention — you have to expose yourself in some way to that feared situation and prevent your usual responses, which only make the phobia worse.
That's (done) by having a therapist guide you through and teach you all these relaxation and therapeutic techniques to manage your anxiety as it comes.
Over time, you essentially become desensitized to those triggers.
Virtual reality treatment guided by a therapist can also help.
See what you can do along the way to make flying the least unpleasant.
When you're feeling panicked, meditation, progressive muscle relaxation and 10 minutes of paced deep breathing can help.
You're inhaling through your nose to a count of five, holding it for a second or two, then exhaling through pursed lips to a count of seven.
Watching or listening to something that relaxes you can distract you from anxious thoughts.
If you're traveling with someone, discuss your thoughts with them.
For many people, their fear is based on flying just seeming like an impossible feat.
Educating themselves on the mechanics of aerodynamics is helpful.
It's called intellectualizing as a defense mechanism.
CNN: Some people may think, “Although plane accidents are rare, I never know if I'm going to be on one of those flights that end in disaster.”
How can they cope with that awareness? .
Saltz: While I said these are irrational fears, of course any fear can have a kernel of truth to it, and most of these do.
One thing experts do is educate patients about the statistics to put things into perspective — like how you are much more likely to die in a car accident, get hit by a car while crossing the street or even be struck by lightning than you are to die in a plane crash.
And you get in your car or cross the street every day.
There's very little in life that truly has zero risk.
Every day we walk around accepting a certain amount of risk to live our lives.
And luckily, most of us don't go around and think, “I better not cross the street because I could get hit by a bus.”
Most people can think thoughts that allow them to go, such as “I'm going to look both ways, then cross the street” or “I'm going to book with a known airline.”.
CNN: How can parents talk to kids about plane accidents without fostering a phobia? .
Saltz: Your tone is important.
If you sound alarmist, it doesn't even matter what the content is — your child will be alarmed.
If you can't talk about it calmly because you're freaked out, go away (and) return when you're calmer.
Try to keep news and social media from your child.
You understand you're seeing the same event posted over and over again, but for your kid, it feels like the event is happening over and over again.
Say you'll answer any questions the best you can, and that the incident was an incredibly rare one and that millions of safe flights happen all the time.
Reassure them you would not take them on something you're concerned isn't safe.
CNN: How long does overcoming aerophobia take? .
Saltz: It can be different for every person, but some people really do get better in eight or 10 weekly therapy sessions.
Some people's phobia is resistant, so recovery can take longer and be very difficult.
But many people do respond in a shorter time period. .
Therapy may keep the phobia at bay for years or, for some people, permanently.
Others might need to come back in and re-engage in treatment.
It's hard — if you've got a phobia and you think the most terrorizing thing that could possibly happen to you is to be exposed to this thing which makes you terrified, then you have to have a certain amount of faith and trust in the system and belief that this (treatment) can help you.

Title: Asia markets slump as Trump's new trade war rattles global confidence | CNN Business
# Asia markets slump as Trump's new trade war rattles global confidence | CNN Business.
Hong Kong CNN — .
Asia markets slumped on Monday after Donald Trump slapped tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, sparking fears of another bruising 'America First' trade war that could hit global growth.
Japan's Nikkei plunged more than two percent at one point on Monday and Hong Kong's Hang Seng was down more than one percent.
South Korea's KOSPI was down more than two percent at one point.
Shanghai was closed for the Lunar New Year holiday.
China's markets will resume trading on Wednesday.
The US dollar soared to a record high against the Chinese yuan.
“Trump's trade war has started,” Alvin Tan, head of Asia currency strategy at RBC Capital Markets in Singapore told Reuters, noting it was hard to see the dollar retreating any time soon.
Trump announced over the weekend that tariffs will amount to a significant 25% duty on all imports from Mexico and most goods from Canada, and a 10% tariff on Chinese goods imported into the United States.
The tariffs - which Trump says are needed to combat the flow of migrants and fentanyl into the US - are due to come into effect on Tuesday.
Canada and Mexico have announced retaliatory tariffs, and China has said it will challenge the move at the World Trade Organization.
On Sunday evening, Trump also threatened to enact additional tariffs on the European Union — accusing the EU of being “really out of line.”.
Trump later said he plans to speak with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday morning, less than a day before the US' tariffs on the country are scheduled to go into effect.
“The surprise for markets … is that Canada and Mexico retaliated immediately and that others, i.e. China and the EU, may follow their lead, resulting in a sharp contraction in global trade,” Tony Sycamore, a market analyst at IG told Reuters.

Title: In public, they ran a successful global business.

# In public, they ran a successful global business.
In private, police allege they abused hundreds ofchildren | CNN.
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia CNN — .
Millions dined in their restaurants worldwide, getting a taste of Malaysia supplied by a sprawling conglomerate that claimed to embrace Islamic values by caring for thousands of disadvantaged children they said were orphans in homes across the country.
But the leaders of Global Ikhwan Services and Business Holdings (GISBH) are now fighting allegations they ran a cult-like organization that forced followers to work and have many children, some allegedly conceived through rape, to populate orphanages and raise donations that funded their lavish lifestyles.
When Malaysian police raided two dozen homes run by the company in mid-September, they rescued over 600 children and have since detained hundreds of people, charging some with crimes including child trafficking, sexual abuse and organized crime.
GISBH lawyer Rosli Kamaruddin says the group's leaders plan to fight the charges.
In a monthslong investigation CNN spoke to more than a dozen people including former members, their lawyers, and religious scholars to understand how for decades Global Ikhwan, and the alleged abuse they perpetrated, remained Malaysia's best-kept secret.
Former followers told CNN they had no contact with the outside world or access to cellphones and received their only news via an in-house television channel that promoted the teachings of Al Arqam, an Islamic cult that was banned by the Malaysian government in the mid-90s for “deviant” beliefs that strayed far from orthodox teachings.
This is the story of the cult's apparent revival - complete with its own prison islands and “holy water” infused with the leaders' hair and bathwater that former members say was sprayed on goods produced in their factories and on meals served to diners at their restaurants.
CNN has reached out to GISBH for comment on the allegations within this story but is yet to receive a response.
Royal Malaysia Police launched a series of raids in September on dozens of care homes operated by GISBH, and over several weeks rescued hundreds of children they say were the offspring of company employees.
In one press briefing, Police Inspector General Razarudin Husain told reporters children were groomed, malnourished and subject to “child labor, exploitation.”
Health screenings conducted on 392 children found all had suffered physical or emotional abuse.
“They themselves were abused by their caretakers.
Then they were forced to sodomize other children,” Husain told another press briefing.
As the raids unraveled, GISBH restaurants, grocery stores and laundromats were closed, blinds drawn, logos stripped off the walls and social media accounts shut down.
Some of the groups' members fled back to their hometowns across Malaysia and were awaiting instructions from the group's leaders as to what to do next, their families said.
In raids on houses affiliated with GISBH leadership, police found dozens of books and photographs associated with Ashaari Muhammad, the founder of Al Arqam.
Some had been buried in a riverbed, their pages caked in mud.
Al Arqam was an Islamic group - led by Ashaari, known as “Abuya” or Father to his followers - that believed in building a self-sufficient Islamic community with Malaysia at the center of the Muslim world.
It was banned by the Malaysian government in 1994 for “deviant” teachings, a decision that at the time was questioned by international rights groups as a potential breach of religious freedom.
Ashaari subsequently spent 10 years under house arrest and died in 2010.
GISBH's promotional material says the company was founded by Ashaari “with the aim to develop the Islamic way of life in all aspects of life such as education, arts and culture, animal farming.”
Before the raids, GISBH had about 100 care homes housing many of the 3,000 “youths” the group claimed to be their “employees,” according to former members and information from the company's website.
One of Ashaari's daughters, Ummu Atiyah, told CNN the movement had changed since her father's leadership.
“Women are treated with all kinds of abuse … and all the money only goes to the leaders' comfort” she said.
“They have jet skis, motorhomes, vehicles that were not there when my father led the movement.”.
Those arrested include GISBH CEO Nasiruddin Mohd Ali who admitted in a video statement that “one or two cases of sodomy” occurred, but he rejected all other allegations made against the group as slander.
“I am not trying to blame the law.
Indeed, we have done some wrong in the eyes of the law […] Indeed, there were one or two cases of sodomy, but why lump them all together?
” he said.
Nasiruddin, alongside other GISBH leadership, has since been charged with belonging to an organized crime group and is currently awaiting trial.
Among those also charged is Mohammad Adib At-Tarmimi, the son of Ashaari.
The highly publicized case shocked the nation.
While most Malaysians had heard about Abuya and Al Arqam back in the 90s, few knew about their connection to GISBH and the alleged abuses that went on inside the company.
But it came as no surprise to anyone who had ever worked for GISBH.
## Scabies, stitches and secrets .
Farid, who recently left GISBH, was 27 when he joined the group in 2010 after years of struggling with drug addiction.
“I give my soul, I give myself to them because they want to fix me,” said Farid, who asked to use a pseudonym to protect his family.
He was in an arranged marriage with the daughter of a senior member and quickly had two daughters.
When their older daughter turned two, she was sent to live in a charity home, like most GISBH children.
At first glance, some of the welfare homes bear no association to GISBH.
Some carried the GISBH logo, but others appeared to be normal houses with yards strewn with toys on quiet suburban streets.
Facebook pages run by the homes show small children said to be orphans in religious garb, singing and praying, imploring followers to donate or give zakat to buy food, clothes or school supplies.
Zakat is a form of religious alms-giving and one of the five mandatory pillars of Islam.
But the children were not orphans.
In most cases their parents were GISBH workers, like Farid, though some hadn't seen their kids in years.
Instead, they were raised by caretakers who in some cases were only a few years older than them, according to former members and law enforcement.
The days were spent studying Islam and praying, not just to Allah but to Nasiruddin, the chief executive of GISBH and other leaders of the company, Farid, who briefly worked at a boys' care home in the 2010s, told CNN.
The kids were told, “Your mother is nothing, your father is nothing, there is only your leader - Nasiruddin,” he said.
“At night the children sleep with tears [in their eyes].”.
Over time many of the children came to believe they actually were orphans, he added, while authorities said some couldn't identify their parents.
Farid says his daughter quickly changed after moving into a welfare home.
“My daughter was a cheerful girl, always smiling, always laughing but when she went there, she was very sad, she had no self-confidence,” he said.
When he visited his daughter, he said she looked malnourished, her hands covered in scabies - an infection caused by mites that burrow their way under the skin and lay eggs there.
The condition was seen in many children who were rescued from the care homes, according to images shared with CNN.
Amir, another former GISBH worker, told CNN that before he left the group in 2021, he tried to visit his four-year-old son at the care home as often as possible.
Amir, who asked to use a pseudonym to protect his family, said caretakers told him the boy was often crying and wetting his pants.
One time he visited, his son had stitches on his chin and forehead.
Amir said a caretaker had admitted throwing the boy in anger after he wet himself.
The boy also told his father he was locked in a dog kennel as punishment.
“They asked me to keep the matter a secret,” Amir said, but he said almost everyone at the group knew about other instances of abuse that went on in the care homes.
If their child hadn't been hurt, they knew somebody whose kid had been, he said.
The group's headquarters was a sprawling compound complete with horse stables in the town of Rawang, a 30-minute drive from the capital Kuala Lumpur.
One local resident recalled that the arrival of the Al Arqam-linked community in the early 2000s drew attention from locals, but there was an “unspoken boundary” between the group and the rest of the town's residents.
Life inside the community was tightly controlled.
Former followers told CNN they had no contact with the outside world or access to cellphones.
An in-house production company made news-like programming about their leaders that was broadcast on their own television channel called Ikhwan TV.
Programming included prayers, cartoons and live coverage from motorsport and equestrian events organized by the group, according to former members.
“GISBH embodies the criteria of a cult - absolute loyalty to leaders, charismatic leader at the core of the movement; exclusive membership and severe penalty for leaving, members' loss of personal autonomy,” said Dr Azmil Tayeb, a political scientist and associate professor at Universiti Sains Malaysia, who specializes in Islamic political and social movements.
Men and women, even married couples, lived in gender-segregated dorms and were not allowed to meet without the leaders' approval, former members said.
Even if you saw your wife in the courtyard you couldn't speak to her, Farid recalled.
Instead, married couples had to apply for what were essentially conjugal visits, scheduled appointments where couples were expected to have sex, several former members said.
Viagra was provided and in some cases group leaders demanded to know the details the next morning, said Farid.
“I saw myself as a sex slave, I didn't see myself as a wife,” said Zoey, a former member from Singapore, who left the group in 2021 and asked to use a pseudonym to protect her young children.
“The role as a woman in GISB is only for you to give birth.”.
Zoey's family joined GISBH when she was a teenager, and she struggled to adapt to the restrictive culture of the group.
At the age of 17, she was deemed “uncontrollable” by the leadership and married to a man 10 years her senior.
Within weeks of being married, her husband became physically and sexually abusive towards her, she said.
He regularly raped her, she said.
Zoey said she tried to go on birth control pills but when her husband found out, she was beaten again and forced to stop.
Her complaints to the group elders went unheard, she said.
Instead, she was told to obey her husband as “he is your heaven.”.
Zoey fled the marriage and now cares for their nine children in Singapore - the eldest nearly the age she was when she was forced to marry.
Other female members CNN spoke to echoed Zoey's experience of abuse and sexual violence.
Many of them said they were forcibly married as teenagers, others gifted to men as rewards for business successes.
In 2022, the group claimed to have more than 5,000 employees working in restaurants, bakeries, factories and supermarkets and other businesses in 20 countries including Australia, the UK, France, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, where they also ran a resort, according to their website and news reports.
Farid and Amir both recall working from dusk until dawn in Ikhwan factories producing noodles, chili sauce, and other condiments 365 days a year.
Like most GISBH employees, they said they were never paid for their work but were provided food and board.
Sometimes their colleagues were children, they said.
Photos shared with CNN show prepubescent children packaging noodles and operating factory machinery.
The minimum age for full-time work in Malaysia is 15 .
The company's unsettling practices allegedly extended to the food factories where workers sprayed so-called holy water on products sold to the public, according to several former members.
“Holy water” or “Air Berkat” was a concoction made by mixing the leaders' saliva, body hair and bathwater.
Members of the group believed that each part of their leaders' bodies contained “berkat” or spiritual-magical properties.
“I made chili paste, chili sauce and noodles, so I sprayed it [holy water] over them,” one former member told CNN.
These products were then sold to the public in GISBH-owned supermarkets and used in their restaurants across the country, the former members said.
The group's overseas assets were among some of their most prized, despite them never turning profits, according to financial records analyzed by CNN.
One former member told CNN that the overseas assets were a way for the group to gain “popularity” and build influence.
Most former members CNN spoke to had at some point lived and worked abroad, living in company dorms, some while they were only teenagers.
These locations also served as informal meeting places for the company to build relationships with government officials, Tayeb, the political scientist, explained.
“They've always been well connected; we are not talking about an isolated cult in the middle of the jungle,” said Tayeb.
GISBH's connections reached the highest level of Malaysia's elites.
In April 2023, the executive chairman of the group and several other senior leaders met with Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim at his private office.
At the meeting, the prime minister “promised to help all efforts of GISBH in the name of the Muslim economy,” according to an article posted on Ikhwan News, the group's own media publication.
Following the raids in September, Anwar urged police and religious authorities to investigate and take appropriate action to address misconduct at the company.
While some employees worked 16-hour shifts in factories, restaurants and resorts, GISBH leadership spent their time jetting around the world, meeting the highest rungs of Malaysian leadership and attending sporting events, with Nasiruddin taking a special interest in horseback riding and motorsports.
Followers were told not to question the leaders' lavish spending for it was all done in the name of Islam, one former member said.
“They say we buy superbikes for Islam,” said the former member, who wished to remain anonymous.
Anyone who asked questions or dissented was sent to “quarantine,” faraway camps where members spent months living in jungle huts with no water or electricity, repenting their sins, said several former members, recalling their experience.
As one former member put it: “You ask today, tomorrow they send you to the quarantine island.”.
Nearly every single former GISBH member CNN spoke to had at one point been sent to quarantine.
Zoey said she spent nearly half a year in quarantine while pregnant with her second child, where she was forbidden from speaking to anyone and denied medical checkups.
Amir said he spent 10 months in quarantine on Tioman Island, a nature reserve popular with tourists off the main coast of Malaysia.
He said he was sent there as punishment for trying to escape after learning about his son's abuse.
Since the raids in September, most of the children have returned to the care of their parents, but over 100 children are yet to be claimed by their families, authorities said.
A lawyer representing several former members told CNN that in some cases children refuse to go home with parents who left the group because they'd been taught to fear them.
“My children don't love or respect me anymore.
They have been brainwashed,” the lawyer recalled one of his clients telling him.
The years of indoctrination will take some time to undo.
After attending reeducation programs, the GISBH children will eventually be introduced to mainstream schools, according to Malaysia's education ministry.
There, they will for the first time become a part of Malaysian society.
For the adults not facing charges, the future is unclear.
Those who grew up inside the group have few life skills to fall back on, and many of the men have multiple wives and many children they now need to support.
Former members told CNN a sense of security came with living within GISBH.
Their lives were at times lonely and limited, but one day they hoped to reap the rewards of their devotion.
“They say if you are in the group, you are on the highway to Heaven,” Farid said.
Outside, Zoey said, former members “have nowhere to go.”.
On January 9 GISBH posted a message on their Facebook page after months of silence.
“Some people are created to be a test to other people,” it read.
“So be patient with all this.”.

Title: Live updates: Grammys wins for Beyoncé and Kendrick Lamar highlight 2025 show | CNN
# Live updates: Grammys wins for Beyoncé and Kendrick Lamar highlight 2025 show | CNN.
According to the man running it, the Grammys has made some improvements.
Harvey Mason Jr. , chief executive officer of the Recording Academy and MusiCares, took to the stage Sunday night to address what had been a bumpy road for the award show.
“When I took on this role back in 2020, I wanted the organization to change and modernize so we could be better and serve this dynamic and global music community,” Mason said.
“But my early days were not exactly straightforward.
The Academy faced some real criticism for many in our music community.” .
.
One of those critics was acclaimed singer The Weeknd.
Mason said he remembered “waking up to the headlines that the Weeknd called out the Academy for lack of transparency in our awards” adding that the Canadian R&B and pop star “went so far as to announce he was boycotting the Grammys.” .
Since then, Mason said, the Academy has made some changes and “remade our membership, adding more than 3,000 women voting members.”.
“The Grammy electorate is now younger, nearly 40% people of color, and 66% of our members are new,” Mason said.
“Since we started our transformation this year, the 13,000 voting members of the Academy nominated their peers and voted for the winners that you're seeing on this stage tonight.
It's a system rooted in fairness, integrity, and the principle that every voice in our community matters.”.
.
And as proof that times are changing, he welcomed The Weeknd back to the Grammys stage Sunday night.
The Weeknd performed two songs from his new album “Hurry Up Tomorrow,” including “Cry For Me” and “Timeless,” the latter featuring an appearance by rapper Playboi Carti.
It was the first time the singer returned to the Grammys stage since 2021, when he accused the Recording Academy, the group behind the Grammys, for being “corrupt” on his X page after he was shut out of earning any nominations that year for his acclaimed album “After Hours”. .
The Weeknd's return was certainly a statement, with the audience rising to their feet to watch him sing his newest songs from atop a large platform.
Smoke billowed from the stage through laser lights throughout the four-time Grammy-winner's performance.
“Hurry Up Tomorrow” was released on Friday.

Title: DeepSeek chaos suggests 'America First' may not always win | CNN Business
# DeepSeek chaos suggests 'America First' may not always win | CNN Business.
CNN — .
The stunning rise of DeepSeek is sending s hockwaves through the artificial intelligence world , threatening America's dominance that seemed set in stone just a week ago.
The fact that a little-known Chinese startup has built a model that can compete with leading US AI systems is challenging the conventional wisdom that it takes gobs of money and unlimited access to cutting-edge computer chips to train AI technology.
It shouldn't really be possible for a Chinese AI startup to go toe-to-toe with OpenAI's GPT-4o and Google's Gemini.
Now, President Donald Trump has to decide how to respond.
The United States has imposed tough restrictions that are designed to prevent Chinese firms from buying or building their own cutting-edge computer chips required to train AI models.
These chips are at the heart of the AI arms race and the goal of the export curbs is to prevent China from keeping up.
Some have argued that DeepSeek's success - it claims to have trained its new AI model R1 at a fraction of the cost and on far fewer high-end chips than leading AI models - shows the Biden and first Trump administrations' export curbs have backfired: These tough restrictions may have backed Beijing into a corner, forcing Chinese firms to come up with ways to innovate around the export curbs or build their own chips.
“Rather than impeding China, these AI export controls may be accelerating China's AI capacity by pushing them to innovate,” John Villasenor, a professor of engineering and law at UCLA, told CNN in a phone interview.
“The export controls, arguably, are counterproductive.”.
That would be a blow to the tough crackdowns under both Trump and former President Joe Biden - and the ones envisioned during this new Trump administration.
“We accidentally upped their technical game,” AI researcher Gary Marcus wrote in a Substack post .
“It is clear that the game has changed.” .
That notion - that punishing restrictions may have had the opposite effect as the United States intended - is raising tough questions about the very foundation of the AI boom, the tech arms race between the United States and China and how the Trump administration should respond.
Trump may be unswayed.
“I think Trump doubles down,” said Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James, noting that Trump has surrounded himself with China hawks, such as Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
“His advisers around him point to more restrictions, not less.”.
If Trump adds even more pressure on China over AI, proponents of a more hawkish strategy believe China's house of AI cards may crumble.
Skeptics say it's not clear how much of a gamechanger DeepSeek is.
They argue its success could have been made possible either stockpiling high-end chips before restrictions were imposed or by buying the semiconductors on the black market.
“It is either a Sputnik Moment or a Potemkin Moment,” Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management, told CNN in an email.
“It is either truly disruptive or deceptive, relying on hoarded Nvidia chips and others before the export sanction.”.
Sonnenfeld added that if it is a “Sputnik-style disruption, it is a blow to pure reliance on competitive private markets without government partnership and national industrial policies.”.
Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang told CNBC that he understands DeepSeek has 50,000 leading-edge chips that they “can't talk about, obviously, because it is against the export controls that the United States has put in place.”.
Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management, urged investors to take DeepSeek's claims “with a grain of salt” because there is no concrete proof to back them up.
“China is claiming it has come up with the silver bullet, but it could be like the guy in high school who says he has a girlfriend, but she's just at a different school,” Hogan said in a phone interview, noting that there has long been skepticism among Western economists about the veracity of China's economic statistics.
If DeepSeek did have access to leading edge chips, that supports the argument that the export controls should be toughened.
Mills notes that there is a “very active” black market for high-end chips and enforcement of export controls has been uneven.
“This has been a game of whack-a-mole,” Mills said.
“There are still glaring loopholes that need to be closed.”.
For example, Mills pointed to the need for more robust enforcement and further restrictions on the flow of leading-edge computer chips.
Jake Sullivan, the US National Security Adviser under Biden, has acknowledged that the export controls are a work in progress.
“This is an iterative process.
We learn, they learn.
We learn, they learn,” Sullivan said in May during a fireside chat. .
Sullivan also noted that China has tried to overwhelm export controls by projecting an air of inevitability to its AI ambitions.
“The PRC has embarked on a massive and relentless information campaign to basically say, 'This is futile.
Resistance is futile.
We will break these controls,'” Sullivan said.
The stakes are massive.
Many in Washington were well aware that the United States is in an AI arms race.
But that race may be a bit closer, and perhaps significantly cheaper, than previously known.

Beyoncé has won more Grammy Awards than anyone in history, but there was always one big category missing from her trophy case: album of the year.
That changed Sunday night, as her genre-bending “Cowboy Carter” took top honors and gave her that elusive win .
“I just feel full and very, very honored,” Beyoncé said while accepting the award.
“It's been many, many years.”.
Earlier in the night, Beyoncé became the first Black woman in more than 50 years to win a country Grammy when she and Miley Cyrus won the award for best country duo/group performance (“II Most Wanted”).
“Cowboy Carter” also won the Grammy for best country album.
“I think sometimes genre is a cold word to keep us in our place as artists,” Beyoncé said.
“And I just want to encourage people to do what they're passionate about and stay persistent.”.
Rapper Kendrick Lamar was another big winner Sunday night, as “Not Like Us” — the capstone of his feud last year with Drake — won both record of the year and song of the year .
“At the end of the day, (there is) nothing more powerful than rap music,” he said.
I don't care what it is.
We are the culture.
It's going to always stay here forever.”.
Comedian Trevor Noah hosted the event for the fifth straight year.
This year's telecast also focused on raising funds to support relief efforts and aid for music professionals who were impacted by the devastating wildfires in Los Angeles County .
Near the end of the show, Noah said $7 million had already been raised by people watching from home .
Some of the other major winners Sunday included Chappell Roan, who won best new artist; Sabrina Carpenter, who won best pop vocal album ("Short n' Sweet”); and Doechii, who won best rap album (“Alligator Bites Never Heal”)..

Title: 'Mona Lisa' will get its own room under a 10-year renovation of the Louvre in Paris | CNN
# 'Mona Lisa' will get its own room under a 10-year renovation of the Louvre in Paris | CNN.
Paris, France AP — .
French President Emmanuel Macron announced Tuesday that the “Mona Lisa” will get its own dedicated room inside the Louvre museum under a major renovation and expansion of the Paris landmark that will take up to 10 years.
The renovation project, branded “Louvre New Renaissance,” will include a new entrance near the River Seine, to be opened by 2031, and the creation of underground rooms, Macron said in a speech from the Louvre room where Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece is displayed.
Macron did not disclose the cost, estimated to run into hundreds of millions of euros, to modernize the most visited museum in the world , plagued with overcrowding and outdated facilities.
But it is estimated to reach up to 800 million euros ($834 million). .
The Louvre's latest overhaul dates back to the 1980s, when the iconic glass pyramid was unveiled.
Now, the museum is not up to international standards anymore.
A look at what's at stake:.
Macron said the expansion of the museum will allow the “Mona Lisa” to be moved to a new, dedicated room accessible to visitors through a special ticket.
That will make the visit simpler for those who want to see the painting and ease the life of other visitors in the rest of the museum, he said.
The “Mona Lisa” is now being shown behind protective glass in the museum's largest room, overcrowded with long, noisy queues of visitors eager to take a selfie with Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece.
That makes some other paintings in the room by the greatest Venetian painters like Titian and Veronese go unnoticed by many.
The museum's latest big renovation in the 1980s was designed to receive 4 million annual visitors.
Last year, the Louvre received 8.7 million visitors, over three-quarters being foreigners mostly from the United States, China and neighboring countries Italy, the UK, Germany and Spain.
## A costly and complex overhaul .
Macron said a new entrance for the Louvre will be created near the River Seine by 2031, to be financed by ticket sales, patronage and licensing money from the museum's Abu Dhabi branch. .
A design competition is to be staged in the coming months, he said.
In addition, some new underground rooms will be created to expand the museum.
A French top official said the cost of the renovation is estimated at 700 to 800 million euros ($730 to 834 million) over the next ten years, including half for the creation of the new entrance.
The official could not be named in line with the French presidency's customary practices.
Macron said ticket prices will be raised for foreign visitors from outside the European Union, up from 22 euros ($23) now.
He promised the museum will be safer and more comfortable for both the public and the staff.
Half the Louvre's budget is currently being financed by the French state, including the wages of the 2,200 employees.
The other half is provided by private funds including ticket sales, earnings from restaurants, shops and bookings for special events, as well as patrons and other partners.
## Water leaks and other damage .
The renovation announcement comes after Louvre Director Laurence des Cars expressed her concerns in a note to Culture Minister Rachida Dati earlier this month saying the museum is threatened by “obsolescence.”.
According to the document first released by French newspaper Le Parisien, she warned about the gradual degradation of the building due to water leaks, temperature variations and other issues “endangering the preservation of artworks.”.
The pyramid that serves as the museum's entrance, unveiled in 1989 as part of late President François Mitterrand's project, now appears outdated.
The place is not properly insulated from the cold and the heat and tends to amplify noise, making the space uncomfortable for both the public and the staff, des Cars stressed.
In addition, the museum suffers from a lack of food offerings and restroom facilities, she said.

Title: How a train station tragedy is threatening to bring down a hardline European president | CNN
# How a train station tragedy is threatening to bring down a hardline European president | CNN.
CNN — .
On the first day of November, Aleksandar Matkovic was running late for a train.
He was traveling from Novi Sad, in the north of Serbia, to its capital Belgrade, where he works as an economic historian.
When he got to the station, he witnessed a scene of horror that has rocked the country to this day.
Minutes before he arrived, the canopy of the station - where reconstruction had been completed months earlier - had collapsed, crushing passengers waiting on the platform.
Fifteen people were killed.
“I stood there for about two or three hours, just staring blankly at the space where the canopy was.
The whole thing was so unrealistic,” Matkovic told CNN.
Shock soon turned to anger.
The crumbled canopy has come to serve as a potent symbol of what many Serbs see as corruption at the heart of the state, sculpted by President Aleksandar Vucic and his government over 12 years in power.
What began as vigils for the dead have become near-daily protests, drawing in ever-larger segments of Serbian society and reaching every corner of the Balkan nation.
“We're in uncharted territory,” said Matkovic.
The student-led demonstrations, demanding the full release of documents about the reconstruction works, have become so large and so lasting that some have questioned whether they could bring down Vucic's reign.
“All sorts of questions are going through people's minds,” said Matkovic.
Vucic has dominated Serbia since coming to power as prime minister in 2014, then president three years later.
A former information minister for the brutal Yugoslav regime of Slobodan Milosevic, Serbian democracy has degraded under Vucic's Serbian Progressive Party (SNS).
Freedom House, which measures the strength of democracies, said Serbia declined from “free” to “party free” in 2019, citing attacks on the media and concentration of power in the hands of the president.
His regime is hard to categorize, analysts say.
It is not as repressive as Aleksander Lukashenko's Belarus, but neither as permissive as Viktor Orban's Hungary.
Ivana Stradner, a fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, said Vucic has “made Serbia what Russia was like in the early 1990s, leaning towards a criminal, corrupt state with no rule of law.”.
Still, his detractors praise him as a canny operator.
In an increasingly multipolar world, countries such as Serbia - a regional powerhouse that the West has tried to prize away from its historic ally Russia - enjoy plenty of options.
For Moscow, Serbia can stem the westward slide of other Balkan nations.
For Europe, a huge proposed lithium mine could make it important for the green transition.
For China, Serbia offers the chance to extend its influence through the Belt and Road Initiative.
Even some in the United States have interests in the country.
Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump's son-in-law, is reportedly working on a deal to build a Trump-branded hotel in Belgrade, with capital from various Gulf states.
For Serbia, this transactional approach may not add up to a coherent ideology - it has sold weapons to Ukraine but refuses to join sanctions against Russia - but it has been profitable.
Serbia has been kept plied with Russian gas, Chinese infrastructure, European investment, and even glitzy American construction projects.
This “strategic ambiguity,” as Stradner calls it, has come at the cost of domestic discontent, however.
“People have had enough,” said Engjellushe Morina, a senior fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.
“The students are fed up with this rhetoric … where Vucic says one thing for internal consumption and another thing for international consumption.”.
Anger with the government had been brewing for years.
In May 2023, when Serbia was rocked by two mass shootings , people protested the country's “culture of violence.”
There were more demonstrations after a disputed election later that year, with the opposition calling for a rerun.
They also lasted for weeks but eventually fizzled out.
This time is different, protesters and analysts say.
Latent discontent with the government found its expression in the Novi Sad station tragedy.
The station had been hastily reopened in 2022 - with Vucic and Orban in attendance - ahead of an election held that year, before being closed for more works by a Chinese company and its subcontractors.
Matkovic said Serbs felt the project was “fast tracked” and “pushed by political elites.”
It reopened in July 2024, just four months before its newly built canopy collapsed.
While previous scandals have failed to stick to Vucic, this one has.
The perception of alleged corruption is “one thing that unifies all people,” said Stradner.
Serbian prosecutors have so far indicted 13 people for their role in the disaster, including the former minister for construction, transport and infrastructure, but protesters have demanded that more be done to hold people politically and criminally accountable.
Analysts say Vucic is skilled in thwarting protests by making targeted concessions, jettisoning allies, catching the opposition off-guard or ridiculing the movement.
He regularly labels protesters as “foreign agents” attempting to stage a “color revolution,” as in other former Soviet states.
But these demonstrations represent a new challenge.
Because they began as acts of mourning, they were largely free of “political” signs such as European Union flags, which Vucic has previously used to discredit demonstrations.
The protests have also drawn in broad swaths of Serbian society.
In scenes reminiscent of the end of Milosevic's regime, farmers have joined in, driving their tractors into Belgrade.
Even judges have come on board - a shock, given Vucic's control of much of the judiciary, said Edward P. Joseph, a lecturer at Johns Hopkins University who served for a dozen years in the Balkans, including with NATO.
“Ordinarily they would never dare to raise their head in such public fashion, but now they're showing themselves in silent support of the protests,” Joseph told CNN.
“The fear factor is gone.”.
It is not clear how Vucic can reclaim that power, Joseph said.
Because Vucic must “play this charade” of responsibility, a violent crackdown would be “writing his own epitaph.”.
But the opposite approach - embarking on large-scale democratic reforms - is also challenging, said Morina.
Although Prime Minister Milos Vucevic resigned this week, saying he did so “in order not to further raise tensions in society,” this has done little to satisfy the protesters.
“How convincing is it that he (Vucic) is going to be able to turn this whole movement that he has built - the SNS (the Serbian Progressive Party), the party supporters, the radicals, the football hooligans - how can he turn this into a democratic movement?”
Morina said.
It is not clear what can break the deadlock.
The protest movement has distanced itself from opposition politicians, meaning there is no obvious alternative waiting in the wings.
But this could be a strength, Stradner said.
“It's time to stop having a cult of personality that Serbia has had for decades.
It's time to believe more in laws, in the judiciary, in checks and balances, than to believe in one personality type,” she said.

Title: A shocking Chinese AI advancement called DeepSeek is sending US stocks plunging | CNN Business
# A shocking Chinese AI advancement called DeepSeek is sending US stocks plunging | CNN Business.
CNN — .
US stocks dropped sharply Monday — and chipmaker Nvidia lost nearly $600 billion in market value — after a surprise advancement from a Chinese artificial intelligence company, DeepSeek , threatened the aura of invincibility surrounding America's technology industry.
DeepSeek , a one-year-old startup, revealed a stunning capability last week: It presented a ChatGPT-like AI model called R1, which has all the familiar abilities, operating at a fraction of the cost of OpenAI's, Google's or Meta's popular AI models.
The company said it had spent just $5.6 million on computing power for its base model, compared with the hundreds of millions or billions of dollars US companies spend on their AI technologies.
That sent shockwaves through markets, in particular the tech sector, on Monday.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged by 3.1% and the broader S&P 500 fell 1.5%.
The Dow, boosted by health care and consumer companies that could be hurt by AI, was up 289 points, or about 0.7% higher.
Stock market losses were far deeper at the beginning of the day.
Meta last week said it would spend upward of $65 billion this year on AI development.
Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, last year said the AI industry would need trillions of dollars in investment to support the development of in-demand chips needed to power the electricity-hungry data centers that run the sector's complex models.
Marc Andreessen, a supporter of President Donald Trump and one of the world's leading tech investors, called DeepSeek “one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I've ever seen,” in a post on X .
The stunning achievement from a relatively unknown AI startup becomes even more shocking when considering that the United States for years has worked to restrict the supply of high-power AI chips to China , citing national security concerns.
That means DeepSeek was able to achieve its low-cost model on under-powered AI chips.
US tech stocks got hammered Monday.
Nvidia ( NVDA ), the leading supplier of AI chips, fell nearly 17% and lost $588.8 billion in market value — by far the most market value a stock has ever lost in a single day, more than doubling the previous record of $240 billion set by Meta nearly three years ago.
For perspective, Nvidia lost more in market value Monday than all but 13 companies are worth — period.
Nvidia began the day as the most valuable publicly traded stock on the market — over $3.4 trillion — after its shares more than doubled in each of the past two years.
It ended the day in third place behind Apple and Microsoft.
Meta ( META ) and Alphabet ( GOOGL ), Google's parent company, were also down sharply.
Nvidia competitors Marvell, Broadcom, Micron and TSMC all fell sharply, too.
Oracle ( ORCL ), Vertiv, Constellation, NuScale and other energy and data center companies tumbled.
That dragged down the broader stock market, because tech stocks make up a significant chunk of the market — tech constitutes about 45% of the S&P 500, according to Keith Lerner, analyst at Truist.
“The bottom line is the US outperformance has been driven by tech and the lead that US companies have in AI,” Lerner said.
“The DeepSeek model rollout is leading investors to question the lead that US companies have and how much is being spent and whether that spending will lead to profits (or overspending).”.
This week kicks off a series of tech companies reporting earnings, so their response to the DeepSeek stunner could lead to tumultuous market movements in the days and weeks to come.
In the meantime, investors are taking a closer look at Chinese AI companies.
“Chinese tech companies, including new entrants like DeepSeek, are trading at significant discounts due to geopolitical concerns and weaker global demand,” said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo.
“DeepSeek's rise could spark renewed investor interest in undervalued Chinese AI companies, providing an alternative growth story.”.
The news also sparked a huge change in investments in non-technology companies on Wall Street.
Energy companies had been traded up significantly higher in recent years because of the massive amounts of electricity needed to power AI data centers.
But they all plummeted Monday.
Constellation Energy ( CEG ), the company behind the planned revival of the Three Mile Island nuclear plant for powering AI, fell 21% Monday.
Competitors like Vistra ( VST ) fell 28% and GE Vernova ( GEV ) was down 21%. .
Futures for natural gas, used to power electricity generators, tumbled 5.9%.
Oil fell more than 2%..
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies also tumbled.
One achievement, albeit a gobsmacking one, may not be enough to counter years of progress in American AI leadership.
And a massive customer shift to a Chinese startup is unlikely.
So the market selloff may be a bit overdone — or perhaps investors were looking for an excuse to sell.
“Time will tell if the DeepSeek threat is real — the race is on as to what technology works and how the big Western players will respond and evolve,” said Michael Block, market strategist at Third Seven Capital.
“Markets had gotten too complacent on the beginning of the Trump 2.0 era and may have been looking for an excuse to pull back — and they got a great one here.”.
The industry is also taking the company at its word that the cost was so low.
No one is really disputing it, but the market freak-out hinges on the truthfulness of a single and relatively unknown company.
Although the cost-saving achievement may be significant, the R1 model is a ChatGPT competitor - a consumer-focused large-language model.
It hasn't yet proven it can handle some of the massively ambitious AI capabilities for industries that - for now - still require tremendous infrastructure investments.
“Thanks to its rich talent and capital base, the US remains the most promising 'home turf' from which we expect to see the emergence of the first self-improving AI,” said Giuseppe Sette, president of AI market research firm Reflexivity.

Title: She relocated to Spain in 2022, but after struggling to adapt, this American woman has packed up and returned home | CNN

CNN — .
After vacationing in Spain a few times, Cristina Martinez, from the US, felt enamoured with the European country and was eager to return — for good.
Cristina, who is from a Cuban background and speaks fluent Spanish, eventually decided to relocate there with her husband.
“We wanted to be in Europe and live the European lifestyle,” Cristina tells CNN Travel.
In 2021, the couple, who were based in Fort Myers, Florida, at the time, sold their home and went on to move to Spain the following year.
But after just a year, Cristina realized that the grass isn't always greener on the other side, and was desperate to return to the United States.
She finally moved back home last year, two years after relocating.
“I couldn't adapt to their way of living,” she says.
“It's totally different from the American way of living…
I had very high expectations, and they were totally crumbled.”.
Cristina's ill-fated love affair with Spain began back in 1995, when she visited the country for the first time and instantly fell for its charm.
After visiting a few more times, Cristina returned with her husband and felt certain that “it would be a lovely place to live.”.
She began looking into the prospect of moving there soon after, making sure to do as much research as she could before making a final decision.
“We didn't have good information,” she reflects today.
Once Cristina and her husband had sold their Florida home and gone through the process of applying for a non-lucrative visa - which allows non-EU nationals to live in Spain without working, provided that they can prove that they have enough money to support themselves - they were ready to begin their new lives in Spain.
They left the US in May 2022, heading to Santander, capital city of the Cantabria region on Spain's north coast, where they'd rented a home.
Cristina says she was relatively happy in the beginning and went on to buy a chalet on the countryside of the same region after falling “in love with the area.”.
“I think the first year was like a honeymoon stage,” she says.
“I was more in that stage of, 'Oh, we're in Europe.
This is what we've always wanted.
This is a dream come true.
'”.
However, by the following year, Cristina was seeing things very differently, and soon realized that the Spanish way of life wasn't going to work for her.
“I started to realize… this is not what we had envisioned,” she says.
“I mean, we wanted to be here long-term.
Forever and ever.
“But the way the country is going, and the way they do things, is definitely not what I'm used to.”.
So where did it all go wrong?
Somewhat surprisingly, Cristina says that the weather was one of the main issues for her.
They were based in northern Spain, which has very cold winters, and Cristina admits that she wasn't prepared for quite how gloomy it would be for several months of the year.
“I just couldn't take six months or five months of bad weather,” she says.
“Sometimes it just rains five days out of the week.
It rains day and night….
“You also have a lot of humidity and wind.
And when all those things add up, it's a very cold, gloomy and depressing winter.
And all these elements make it easier for you to get sick.”.
And while Cristina struggled with the cold during winter, the lack of air-conditioning in many Spanish homes meant that summertime wasn't exactly smooth sailing for her either.
“Be prepared to not live with air conditioning,” she says.
“To live with the windows open.”.
When asked if she considered moving south, Cristina explains that she was worried about the prospect of squatters taking over if she purchased a second property in Spain and left one empty.
“The country has a big problem with squatters,” she says, adding that “if you buy a property over there, you run the risk of it being occupied.”.
Spanish laws around squatting are complicated, particularly due to a clause in the Spanish constitution stating that all citizens have “the right to adequate housing.”.
Squatters can only be evicted immediately if they've moved in within the last 48 hours.
If more than two days have passed, homeowners must take the appropriate judicial measures to remove them.
“That's something that we didn't know about,” she adds.
“So that right there was also a big game changer.
“Because here in Miami, we don't have that kind of a problem.
And if we do, it's very minor.”.
Cristina also found the Spanish schedule, which sees some businesses close for siesta in the afternoons, very difficult to adjust to.
“The other thing that really bothered me about them over there (was) their way of living and their way of doing things,” she says.
“All of their businesses and restaurants, for the most part, close at three or four o'clock in the afternoon.
Banks close at two, and then you can't do anything.
There's no services being provided.”.
The differing meal times were another source of frustration for Cristina.
“You can't go and eat because they close at four, and then they don't open again until eight, nine o'clock at night,” she adds.
As for the cost of living, Cristina concedes that she found groceries to be less expensive, although utilities were “just about the same as the US.”.
While she also found housing to be cheaper, Cristina points out that “you get what you pay for.” .
“I noticed that the cheaper homes for rent, you would find them on the outskirts of the big city in remote areas,” she says.
“Out in the country.
Some houses and apartments can be in a town that is not that good.
It may not have that many services.
So it just depends.
“As a foreigner, you really have to do your homework if you want to go live over there.”.
Cristina points out that sales tax is “high” in Spain - the rate averaged 18.76 percent from 2000 until 2024.
“People think that it's cheaper, but you really need to do the math,” she says.
“What are you going to get with the exchange rate?.
“How much money are you really going to have left?
Take into consideration the high sales tax…
Because at the end of the day, it may not be that cheap.”.
While Cristina didn't necessarily have strong opinions about Spanish food before moving there, she grew to dislike it, finding it to be largely “fried, greasy and unhealthy.”.
“After a while, I got really tired and grossed out with the Spaniard food,” she says, noting that there's a little “more variety” in bigger cities such as Madrid and Barcelona.
“You're just like, 'Okay, I'm done with the French fries…
I'm done with the seafood.
' It's like seafood for everything.”.
Although Cristina didn't have issues making friends in the country, she found Spain to be more of a “closed culture.”.
“They don't open up their house to people very easily,” she says.
“They talk to you, but it's not like, 'Oh, come over to my house and have some drinks.'”.
According to Cristina, many of the locals she encountered seemed surprised that she'd chosen to relocate to Spain.
“A lot of people would be like, 'Oh, you're from Miami, but what are you doing here?'” she recounts.
And as time went on, Cristina began to ask herself the same question.
She found herself aching for the convenience she was used to back in Miami, as well as her friends and family.
“The convenience of everything being open,” she says.
“Going to the supermarket or going to a regular pharmacy and finding everything that you need.”.
As she was weighing up her options, Cristina was offered her former social work job back, and decided to accept the offer.
“Once my job was guaranteed, and they offered it to me.
I got a ticket right away, and I left Spain…
” she recounts.
“It just didn't make sense (to stay).
Because I thought staying had nothing to offer me.
So it was a no-brainer.”.
While Cristina has little positive to say about her time in Spain, she admits that she was a big fan of the landscape in the northern coast.
“I like the greenery,” she says.
“It's a very pretty area.
You have the ocean and the mountains together…
There's a lot of pretty scenery.
“It (Cantabria) is a very agricultural part of Spain.
So there's horses, of course, and sheep.
It's peaceful.
Living in the north, it's a peaceful place to live.
And not too much crime.”.
However, the scenery clearly wasn't enough to convince her to remain there.
Now happily back in the US, Cristina says she feels as though she was misled about Spain, and wished she'd have known more about the way the country operates and its “outdated” procedures.
“If I would've known all these things beforehand, I would have never moved to Spain,” she adds.
Cristina admits that she was particularly disappointed by her experiences, as she'd assumed that she'd fit right in due to her background, not to mention the fact that she spoke the language.
“Their lifestyle, the way they live, is very different from the Hispanic way of living,” she says.
“My culture, we're more warm.
We're more tropical, very happy-go-lucky for the most part….
“I feel like we're more cheerful.
We're more optimistic.
We're more like go-getters.
“We have a lot of great opportunities here in the United States, and we've known how to take advantage of that, and we've moved to bigger and better places.”.
When asked if she plans to return to Spain for a visit, Cristina says she's in no hurry to go back.
“It left a really bad taste in my mouth, the whole experience,” she says.
“That I don't even want to go back for vacation.
I'm done.”.
“And it's not only because of my experience.
But because of other people that I've talked to that live over there too.
They're upset too, about their country.
“And I'm not going to tell you that the United States is the perfect country.
It's not.
But we have more things going for us here than over there.
“I would have stayed over there if they had a different way of living.”.

Officials believe there are no survivors after a passenger plane, on approach to Reagan National Airport near Washington, DC, collided Wednesday night with a US Army helicopter midair, sending both aircraft into the Potomac River below, a DC fire official said.
There were 64 people on board the plane and three soldiers in the Army helicopter, according to DC Mayor Muriel Bowser.
First responders were battling cold and windy conditions Thursday as they worked to recover bodies from the Potomac in near-freezing temperatures.
The passenger plane was American Airlines Flight 5342, operated by PSA Airlines, traveling from Wichita, Kansas, to Reagan National, the Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement.
The Bombardier CRJ700 regional jet was due to land at the airport Wednesday night when it collided midair with the US Army helicopter as it approached Runway 33, according to the FAA and defense officials.
The US Army Black Hawk helicopter was on a training flight at the time, Joint Task Force-National Capitol Region media chief Heather Chairez told CNN.
The crash is the deadliest aviation disaster in the United States since November 12, 2001, when an American Airlines flight crashed in New York, killing all 260 people on board.
Here are some of the stories that made headlines over the past week, as well as some photos that caught our eye.

Title: The electric car revolution is on track, says IEA | CNN Business
# The electric car revolution is on track, says IEA | CNN Business.
London CNN — .
Global electric vehicle sales are set to rise by more than a fifth to reach 17 million this year, powered by drivers in China, according to the International Energy Agency.
In a report Tuesday, the IEA projected that “surging demand” for EVs over the next decade was set “to remake the global auto industry and significantly reduce oil consumption for road transport.”.
It expects half of all cars sold globally to be electric by 2035, up from more than one in five this year, provided charging infrastructure keeps pace.
The IEA includes battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles in its definition of EVs.
The agency's bullish long-term outlook for EVs — based on current government policies — comes just days after the world's biggest battery EV maker Tesla slashed its prices in major markets to counter declining sales and growing competition from Chinese upstarts and established carmakers.
Recent negative headlines about slowing EV penetration are out of step with positive global trends, according to IEA executive director Fatih Birol.
The data “does not at all show a reverse of the growth of electric cars.
It shows an extremely robust increase of global electric car sales,” he told reporters Tuesday.
The growth is not driven just by Chinese buyers.
The number of new battery electric cars sold in the European Union rose almost 4% in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period in 2023, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association.
In a statement, Birol said: “Rather than tapering off, the global EV revolution appears to be gearing up for a new phase of growth.”.
Despite the upbeat trends, EV makers are grappling with slim profit margins, squeezed by price wars as competition heats.
In the past few days, Tesla and Chinese EV maker Li Auto have cut prices on major models in China, the world's biggest EV market, with Tesla also cutting prices in Germany and the United States.
Earlier this month, Tesla posted its first annual drop in sales in nearly four years.
The company's stock has plunged more than 40% so far this year.
China's BYD has also stumbled after it briefly surpassed Tesla as global market leader, with its sales falling to about 300,000 in the first quarter from more than 525,000 in the final three months of 2023.
Automakers may be hurting from the price cuts but they will be crucial to increasing the take-up of EVs around the world, according to the IEA, which emphasized that the “pace of the transition to EVs… will hinge on affordability.”.
In China, more than 60% of EVs sold last year were less expensive than conventional cars, but in Europe and the United States the purchase price for new cars with internal combustion engines remains lower on average.
“Intensifying market competition and improving battery technologies are expected to reduce (EV) prices in the coming years,” the IEA said.
“Growing electric car exports from Chinese automakers, which accounted for more than half of all electric car sales in 2023, could add to downward pressure on purchase prices,” it added.
Last year, Chinese carmakers accounted for more than half of global electric car sales, compared with their 10% share of the conventional car market.
“China is the de facto leader of electric car manufacturing around the world,” Birol said.
Concerns about soaring imports of Chinese EVs prompted the European Union to open an investigation late last year into China's state support for EV makers.
The auto industry is a major employer in Europe and crucial to the region's biggest economy, Germany, which is home to Volkswagen, Audi and BMW.
EV sales in China will account for almost 60% of the global total this year and about 45% of all car sales in the country.
By 2030, almost one in three cars on the roads in China is set to be electric, up from fewer than one in 10 last year, according to the IEA.
That compares with its forecast for 17% in the United States and 18% in the European Union, compared with just over 2% and almost 4% respectively last year.
“This shift will have major ramifications for both the auto industry and the energy sector,” Birol said.
The IEA sees global oil demand peaking in 2030, helped by the electrification of the transport sector.
In addition to affordability, another barrier to mass adoption of electric cars is a lack of public charging infrastructure in Europe and the United States.
Under current government policies, the number of public EV charging points worldwide is expected to reach 15 million by the end of the decade, a near-fourfold increase from last year, according to the IEA. .

Title: These Americans don't think the economy is getting any better.
Welcome to 'No Buy 2025' | CNN Business
# These Americans don't think the economy is getting any better.
Welcome to 'No Buy 2025' | CNN Business.
New York CNN — .
When the world is in turmoil, it's easy to impulse buy.
The sentiment has long been pushed on social media — a quick run to HomeGoods or Target, clicking an Amazon affiliate link, or just keeping up with the latest item drops.
Many Americans, especially female content creators, are pushing back against overconsumption and pledging to buy less — or even nothing beyond essentials — as well as not repurchasing a product they own until it has expired or no longer has use.
The campaigns now have coined names such as the “No Buy 2025 Challenge” and “Project Pan.” .
Though underconsumption core has been popular, trends such as Project Pan, or finishing beauty products until you hit the pan, have seen a resurgence in January.
Many are continuing or beginning low- or no-spend journeys in light of recently proposed economic policies in the new Trump administration.
Donald Trump had run for president on the promise of lowering prices.
“When I win, I will immediately bring prices down, starting on Day One,” Trump said at a press conference in August 2024, targeting voters who have been dissatisfied with the price of goods.
But many Americans are still not easing on the economy, despite his promises.
Rylee Marcum, a stay-at-home mom in Central Florida, is taking part in No Buy 2025 and doesn't plan to opt out at any point this year.
Her family of six isn't saving for anything big.
Instead, they are looking to better afford bills, groceries and replenishing household goods.
With the challenge, she says her family saves around $100 a week.
“The new administration is a big reason why I'm doing this because I don't want us to contribute to Trump's economy,” Marcum said.
“That's just a petty reason… but I don't think things are going to get any better at all and I'm scared for the future.”.
Consumer confidence fell for the second straight month in January, according to data from The Conference Board , reflecting how consumers feel about the present economy and the future one reflected by the new administration's policies.
That means Americans are still feeling down about inflation.
Grocery prices are on the rise again.
Eggs, impacted by an aggressive strain of avian flu, are approaching record-high prices .
Coffee prices hit a new high despite Trump walking back a 25% tariff threat on Colombia.
Beef and orange juice prices are also climbing.
The White House confirmed Friday that it would move forward with a 25% duty on Mexico and Canada and a 10% tariff on China.
For Marcum, No Buy 2025 includes cutting out professional nails and haircuts.
Her family doesn't eat out as much or go to the movies unless it's a special occasion, instead utilizing free resources like parks and libraries.
She said she “just can't afford” impulse buys at Target and Marshalls.
Sabrina Pare, a resident of Detroit who is expecting her first child this year, is also participating in No Buy 2025.
“It's really important to practice buying less now and get into the habit of using what you already have, finding things second-hand, because I do think things are going to get more expensive,” Pare said.
Gen Z and millennials are also more attuned to brands that have values they align with.
That, combined with economic anxiety, creates an even greater urge for unintentional spending.
The trends tie into a broader underconsumption core lifestyle , which emerged as a response to influencers peddling new product after new product.
Rebecca Sowden, a 27-year-old from Corona, California, said her inability to control product pricing and current events has forced her to tame her personal spending.
This year, she wants to max out her retirement accounts, save up to live in the same city as her English husband and pay off her car loan.
In January, along with her content-creation side gig, she has saved $4,272 by doing her no-spend pledge.
The pledge has been easier in January because the current administration is “fueling my fire,” Sowden said, and reduces her urge to contribute to companies she feels doesn't align with her values.
“I think I'm saving money — which is good — because spite is a great driving force,” Sowden said.
Phasion Keel, who lives in South Florida, says she has so far saved $300 in January.
Her frugality includes an end to impulsive runs to Dollar Tree, only refilling lip glosses and body washes, and cutting out “ buy now, pay later ” programs like Klarna and Afterpay.
She said the challenge encouraged her to find hobbies outside of consuming.
“Touch grass, because it's not all about going into stores,” Keel said.
“Go out in the sun and go for a walk — that has been helping me with (not) shopping.”.

CNN — .
A year and a half ago, chef Robbie McCauley left behind the swanky kitchens of some of the UK and Ireland's best restaurants to cook in a remote Irish cottage on a cliff overlooking the Atlantic.
The low, whitewashed, flagstone-roofed building surrounded by empty green fields, miles from the nearest town, looks the very definition of rural Ireland.
Close by are the Cliffs of Moher.
This dramatic, windswept landscape carved by wild oceans stands on the westernmost edge of Europe and has made numerous movie appearances.
To the north is Doolin, a village known for its traditional music scene.
Though popular with tourists, the far-flung setting and the cottage's rustic appearance are a far cry from the white-linen-tableclothed world of fine dining.
Expense-account diners and fashionistas are nowhere to be seen.
And yet, within months of McCauley and his wife Sophie opening Homestead Cottage in County Clare, the Michelin Guide gave it a star, while others have hailed it the best restaurant in Ireland — strong praise in a country known for culinary excellence.
The bucolic setting hasn't done the restaurant any harm, with Michelin calling it “surely the most rural” of their newest winners, while noting the “wonderful Irish produce” at the heart of its menu.
It's an achievement all the more remarkable given the precariousness of the restaurant industry in Ireland and many other countries in recent years, with the fate of many hanging on a metaphorical cliff edge just as vertiginous as the landscape on which Homestead Cottage is perched. .
McCauley, from Scotland, and his French restaurateur wife seem more interested in the unique flavors of their westerly corner of Ireland than in winning awards.
“Our ethos is local, seasonal and the best quality we can find,” McCauley tells CNN.
McCauley has been living in the west of Ireland since 2013 but it would be unfair to call him a “blow-in,” as outsiders are known here.
His mother hails from the region and his grandfather was an independent dairy farmer here.
McCauley says he always felt “a kind of a draw to Clare.”.
After training at the Royal Academy of Culinary Arts in London and cooking in top restaurants like Number One in Edinburgh and Campagne in Kilkenny, Ireland, he took a job at the restaurant in Gregan's Castle Hotel in the Burren, County Clare, where he ultimately became head chef, and met his future wife.
By 2023, McCauley was ready for a new challenge.
A local businessman offered the couple the lease on the 200-year-old stonemason's cottage outside the village of Doolin near the famous Cliffs of Moher.
McCauley was skeptical.
It was Sophie, eight months pregnant at the time, who said they “might as well try it.”.
The couple liked the bones of the place.
“I think at the time, something kind of just fitted in my mind,” McCauley says.
The couple had six weeks to get the place up and running.
And then, two weeks to the day before they opened, Sophie had baby Iris.
“It was definitely intense!”
McCauley laughs.
But those first few weeks in July 2023 were quiet.
Then came a rave review from The Irish Times and McCauley says “it just went crazy” after that.
By February 2024 they had a Michelin star.
“That definitely wasn't something that we had ever expected, especially so quickly,” says McCauley.
Homestead Cottage offers a set rather than à la carte menu, which means as little waste as possible.
McCauley enjoys the “freedom to be able to adapt rather than be stuck to a menu that's written.”.
That might mean choosing garlic, broad beans and kohlrabi from their garden.
This will be their fourth year growing asparagus and they're looking forward to their patience paying off with their first good crop.
“The difference is night and day, for the flavor.
And then you're really cooking with the seasons.”.
For McCauley Irish cuisine is not so much about the food, but the produce.
He calls Irish dairy “a world-class product” and thinks Ireland should take more pride in its beef and lamb.
“There isn't the grain pumped into them like in in so many countries.
Ninety percent of it is finished on grass.”.
## Ancient landscape .
McCauley's dishes feature local place names, the location inextricably linked to the produce: North Clare's Flaggy Shore oysters; Moher crab; Connemara scallops; Aran monkfish; Burren beef.
The restaurant is in a region of Clare called The Burren, an area of 330-million-year-old limestone pavements and diverse flora that has UNESCO global geopark status.
McCauley is such a fan of the unique flavor of Burren meat he believes it should have protected status “like Galician beef and Limousin veal,” of northern Spain and central France respectively.
The chef gives most of the credit for his celebrated cooking to his suppliers.
“It takes vegetable growers the bones of six months to get this stuff to us; the butcher raising the lambs — six to eight months.
We're just cooking it at the end of the day.
You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.”.
The Haughs are one of McCauley's suppliers.
Fiona and her father Sean run Market Hall, an award-winning butcher shop and delicatessen in the pretty town of Ennistymon about eight miles (13 kilometers) from Homestead Cottage.
Sean has a farm on the Kilkee cliff walk, to the south.
He's involved in every stage from sourcing to butchering his local beef and lamb.
Fiona says she's known McCauley for years, since he first came in looking for “random things, like lamb's bread.”.
“Robbie is just another level,” she tells CNN.
“Outstanding.
I'd never tasted anything like Robbie's cooking.”.
She will sometimes allow him behind the counter when he visits the butcher shop.
“Can you cut it this way?
Can you do this?
That's the way Robbie is,” she laughs. “
He knows what he wants, from nose to tail.
So that's why I let him in, because he knows more than me!”.
McCauley says he feels fortunate “especially at the moment when things are so tough for the restaurant industry.
We've no backers.
It's just ourselves.”.
He's not surprised that many restaurants are shuttering, blaming the price of produce, soaring utility bills and spiraling staff costs alongside taxes on food and alcohol.
People are drinking less these days too, he says, and hotels with the stability of rooms have an advantage over standalone restaurants.
He wants the Irish government to act.
“Tourism and hospitality support so many jobs throughout so much of the country, especially rurally.
If you lose that, we can't be replaced by chains.”.
He wants to see more catering courses and apprenticeship schemes, especially in rural areas.
Visitors to Homestead Cottage will find tables made from the floorboards of an old mill, with old Singer sewing-machine legs.
A crackling fire warms the room on chillier days.
There are local flagstones underfoot.
“Fine dining is still seen as quite kind of “white tablecloth, that kind of formality,” McCauley says, “But the people who get it, they really get it.” .
Robbie and Sophie are nearing the end of their first year with a Michelin star.
In February, they'll find out if they've held onto it.
“I think we're cooking good food and I hope Michelin keeps appreciating that, but we're not too hung up about it,” McCauley says.
“End of the day, we need a busy restaurant to pay the bills and to pay our staff rather than having the prestige of a Michelin star.”.
McCauley is instead dreaming about the dishes of 2025.
“We should be getting really nice, large turbots in February, when the water's still cold,” he says.
“And then, in the summer, I always love when we get beautiful tomatoes, fantastic crab, lobster…”.
There is one prediction, closer to home, that he's comfortable making:.
“For the first three things for this year, it's going to be lamb, wild garlic and asparagus.”.

Title: Here's what will get more expensive from Trump's tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China | CNN Business
# Here's what will get more expensive from Trump's tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China | CNN Business.
CNN — .
On Saturday, President Donald Trump made good on his promise to impose steep tariffs on America's three largest trading partners — Canada, China and Mexico — citing a national emergency on the flow of fentanyl and undocumented immigrants into the United States.
The action, which is expected to take effect on Tuesday, includes a 25% duty on all imports from Mexico and most goods from Canada (there's a 10% carve-out for energy-related items such as crude oil), and an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods imported into the United States.
Trump has used and promised to employ tariffs for three primary purposes: to raise revenue, to bring trade into balance and to bring rival countries to the negotiating table.
However, economists warn that these moves negatively impact American businesses and consumers, many of whom are still reeling from the sharp rise in inflation in recent years.
The US Chamber of Commerce warned Saturday that tariffs won't solve the yearslong issues at the borders and instead threaten to “upend supply chains” and raise prices for American families.
“Consumers are going to be clearly worse off,” Sung Won Sohn, professor of finance and economics at Loyola Marymount University and chief economist at SS Economics, told CNN on Saturday.
“When you talk about a tariff, it's an economic war; and in war, everybody loses,” he added.
“But hopefully we will come to some better results and conclusions as a result of the pain and suffering that we will go through.”.
About one-third of US imports come from the three countries Trump targeted Saturday.
Their products are among some of the most commonplace and critical items used by Americans, including fruits and vegetables, meat, gas, automobiles, electronics, toys, clothing, lumber, and beer and spirits.
Mexico and Canada supply a significant share of several key food categories .
For example, Mexico is the largest supplier of fruit and vegetables to the US, while Canada leads in exports of grain, livestock and meats, poultry and more.
Agricultural products from Mexico and Canada, in particular, could become more expensive for consumers, as grocery retailers operate on thinner profit margins than most industries.
With little room to absorb higher tariff costs, the grocers may have to pass them on to shoppers.
Although the US typically exports more agricultural goods than it imports, the value of imports has increased faster than that of exports in the past decade, according to the US Department of Agriculture .
Additionally, climate change has increased US reliance on countries like Mexico, where growing conditions are more favorable .
Last year, the US imported $46 billion of agricultural products from Mexico, according to USDA data.
That includes $8.3 billion worth of fresh vegetables, $5.9 billion of beer and $5 billion of distilled spirits.
But the biggest category of agricultural imports from Mexico last year was fresh fruits, of which the US imported $9 billion worth, with avocados accounting for $3.1 billion of that total.
## Fuel and energy .
The US imported $97 billion worth of oil and gas from Canada last year, that country's top export to the US.
The US has become more reliant on Canadian oil since the expansion of Canada's Trans Mountain pipeline, according to data from the US Energy Information Administration.
The tariff on Canadian energy products is only 10%, not the 25% tariff announced on other Canadian exports.
That'll limit the impact on gasoline prices, said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for OPIS.
Another factor is the time of year.
Gas prices are typically near a low for the year in February due to weak demand.
If the tariffs stay in place through summer, the impact will be greater, he said.
And while the impact isn't expected to be felt equally nationwide, it likely will hit America's Heartland the hardest.
Most Canadian oil is shipped to Midwest refineries via pipeline, Kloza said.
The states most likely to be affected are Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Dakota and Wisconsin, he said.
“Interestingly, 12 of those 16 states begin February with an average retail gasoline price under $3 a gallon,” he said.
“That probably won't last.”.
## Cars and car parts .
The US imported $87 billion worth of motor vehicles and $64 billion worth of vehicle parts from Mexico last year, not accounting for December, the top two goods imported from there that year, according to Commerce Department data. (December trade data is due out next week.).
Motor vehicles were also the second-largest good the US imported from Canada last year through November, for a total of $34 billion.
The auto sector is likely “apoplectic” about the new potential tariffs, said Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
US car companies have been able to keep production costs down by hiring lower-wage workers, particularly in Mexico, where much of their production has shifted to in recent years.
But that cost saving will essentially be erased if there's a 25% tariff, she said.
Car manufacturers are unlikely to move their production elsewhere, given they've made sizable investments in existing plants in both countries and it is difficult to source all the raw materials to build cars and their parts from other places.
While the United States is not the manufacturing-focused economy it once was, it still consumes tens of millions of tons of steel a year, feeding industries such as automaking, oil production, construction and infrastructure.
Canada and Mexico are the largest and third-largest exporters of steel to the United States, respectively.
In his first term, President Trump imposed tariffs of 25% on steel imports from most nations worldwide effective June 2018.
But Mexico and Canada, under their free trade deals with the United States, were exempt from those tariffs.
Canada now accounts for nearly a quarter of steel imported by American businesses by weight, while Mexico accounts for about 12%, according to government data provided by the American Iron and Steel Institute, an industry trade group.
However, there is empirical evidence showing that the 2018 tariffs on steel and aluminum did raise prices, Won Sohn said, noting a 2020 Federal Reserve study that found an increase in producer prices, which eventually were passed along to consumers.
## Beer and alcohol .
Beer and liquor may be recession-proof , but they're certainly not tariff-proof.
The result would be a stiff penalty on some of America's favorite libations , including tequila, which can be made only in Mexico and the No. 1 beer brand in the nation, Modelo .
Constellation Brands , which imports Modelo and Corona beer as well as Casa Noble tequila from Mexico, could see its costs leap 16% under Trump's proposed tariff and would likely have to raise prices by about 4.5%, Chris Carey, a Wells Fargo equity analyst, wrote in a November note.
In 2023, the US imported $5.69 billion of beer and $4.81 billion of alcohol from Mexico, according to International Trade Administration data.
When combined, the two categories were the 10th-biggest import from Mexico last year and mark a sharp 126% increase from 2017, International Trade Administration data shows.
While the tariffs could cause further increases in key materials (such as steel, aluminum and grain) for US beer and spirits businesses, the industry is also bracing for the potential of retaliatory tariffs.
## Home construction and furniture .
Softwood lumber, which is sourced from the likes of pine, spruce, firs and other conifers is prized for its light weight, workability and strength.
As such, its applications are vast, but it's a critical ingredient in the US homebuilding industry: Commonly, the skeleton and skin of homes — the framing, roof and siding — consist of softwood lumber.
And 30% of what the US uses annually comes from Canada.
Economists and homebuilders caution that America does not currently have the industrial capacity to meet the demand and that taxing — or worse, cutting off — Canadian lumber imports could further exacerbate the ongoing housing affordability crisis.
“Whether it's lumber tariffs or tariffs on any other import, these can impact the supply chain,” said Nick Erickson, senior director of housing policy for Housing First Minnesota, a trade organization that represents builders, remodelers and other businesses in the North Star State.
“And we've seen in the past that tariffs on lumber, these are paid for by new homebuyers in the cost of their home.”.
And it's not just lumber at risk for tariffs: 71% of the imported $456 million of lime and gypsum (which are used for drywall) came from Mexico in 2023, according to the National Association of Home Builders.
Factoring in the other raw materials and components imported from Canada, Mexico, as well as China (notably the steel, aluminum and home appliances already subject to tariffs), Trump's new tariffs could raise the cost of imported construction materials by $3 billion to $4 billion, the NAHB noted.
Consumer electronics are among the top goods the US imported from China last year, according to federal trade data.
That includes cellphones, TVs, laptops, video game consoles, monitors and all the components that power them.
China also is a major supplier of home appliances.
Those along with toys and footwear are particularly exposed to Trump's tariff threats.
A staggering 99% of shoes sold in the United States are imported, according to the Footwear Distributors & Retailers of America, a trade group that represents Nike, Steve Madden, Cole Haan and other footwear brands.
More than half (56%) of shoes sold in the United States are made in China, the trade group said.
The United States is also reliant on China for toys and sporting equipment, including items such as footballs, soccer balls and baseballs.
The United States gets 75% of its imported toys and sports equipment from China.

Title: Asia markets slump as Trump's new trade war rattles global confidence | CNN Business
# Asia markets slump as Trump's new trade war rattles global confidence | CNN Business.
Hong Kong CNN — .
Asia markets slumped on Monday after Donald Trump slapped tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, sparking fears of another bruising 'America First' trade war that could hit global growth.
Japan's Nikkei plunged more than two percent at one point on Monday and Hong Kong's Hang Seng was down more than one percent.
South Korea's KOSPI was down more than two percent at one point.
Shanghai was closed for the Lunar New Year holiday.
China's markets will resume trading on Wednesday.
The US dollar soared to a record high against the Chinese yuan.
“Trump's trade war has started,” Alvin Tan, head of Asia currency strategy at RBC Capital Markets in Singapore told Reuters, noting it was hard to see the dollar retreating any time soon.
Trump announced over the weekend that tariffs will amount to a significant 25% duty on all imports from Mexico and most goods from Canada, and a 10% tariff on Chinese goods imported into the United States.
The tariffs - which Trump says are needed to combat the flow of migrants and fentanyl into the US - are due to come into effect on Tuesday.
Canada and Mexico have announced retaliatory tariffs, and China has said it will challenge the move at the World Trade Organization.
On Sunday evening, Trump also threatened to enact additional tariffs on the European Union — accusing the EU of being “really out of line.”.
Trump later said he plans to speak with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday morning, less than a day before the US' tariffs on the country are scheduled to go into effect.
“The surprise for markets … is that Canada and Mexico retaliated immediately and that others, i.e. China and the EU, may follow their lead, resulting in a sharp contraction in global trade,” Tony Sycamore, a market analyst at IG told Reuters.

Title: Some 30-second Super Bowl commercials this year are selling for $8 million | CNN Business
# Some 30-second Super Bowl commercials this year are selling for $8 million | CNN Business.
CNN — .
Fox, the broadcaster of this year's Super Bowl matchup, originally sought about $7 million for 30 seconds of ad time during the game, the highest-rated event in the United States.
But corporate demand has surpassed even Fox's expensive ambitions.
The network has sold at least 10 of its Super Bowl commercial spots for upward of $8 million each, a person with direct knowledge of the matter confirmed to CNN.
The $7 million figure was already a record, so $8 million sets the bar even higher for next year's game, given that the Super Bowl is a one-of-a-kind sports and media spectacle.
Despite pressures in almost every other part of the television industry, the Super Bowl just keeps growing.
The $8 million deals were done relatively recently, the source said, after some expected sponsors sought to give up their ad time slots.
Companies pull their advertisements out of the Super Bowl for all sorts of reasons: Sometimes they reserve time months in advance but then conclude that they don't have the perfect 30-second message to spend the money on.
This year, the California wildfires caused one sponsor, State Farm Insurance, to step back.
There are no true take-backs however; the companies that reserved Super Bowl time and opt not to use it wind up with ads on other Fox programs at other times, instead.
In any case, there were more than enough companies eager to replace them, which is why Fox was able to command $8 million.
Some previously announced advertisers include Pepsi, Anheuser-Busch InBev, Squarespace, and Stellantis.
Many other companies will roll out their commercial plans in the days ahead of the February 9 game.

Title: Snapchat's new AI chatbot is already raising alarms among teens and parents | CNN Business
# Snapchat's new AI chatbot is already raising alarms among teens and parents | CNN Business.
CNN — .
Less than a few hours after Snapchat rolled out its My AI chatbot to all users last week, Lyndsi Lee, a mother from East Prairie, Missouri, told her 13-year-old daughter to stay away from the feature.
“It's a temporary solution until I know more about it and can set some healthy boundaries and guidelines,” said Lee, who works at a software company.
She worries about how My AI presents itself to young users like her daughter on Snapchat.
The feature is powered by the viral AI chatbot tool ChatGPT - and like ChatGPT, it can offer recommendations, answer questions and converse with users.
But Snapchat's version has some key differences: Users can customize the chatbot's name, design a custom Bitmoji avatar for it, and bring it into conversations with friends.
The net effect is that conversing with Snapchat's chatbot may feel less transactional than visiting ChatGPT's website.
It also may be less clear you're talking to a computer.
“I don't think I'm prepared to know how to teach my kid how to emotionally separate humans and machines when they essentially look the same from her point of view,” Lee said.
“I just think there is a really clear line [Snapchat] is crossing.”.
The new tool is facing backlash not only from parents but also from some Snapchat users who are bombarding the app with bad reviews in the app store and criticisms on social media over privacy concerns, “creepy” exchanges and an inability to remove the feature from their chat feed unless they pay for a premium subscription.
While some may find value in the tool, the mixed reactions hint at the risks companies face in rolling out new generative AI technology to their products, and particularly in products like Snapchat, whose users skew younger.
Snapchat was an early launch partner when OpenAI opened up access to ChatGPT to third-party businesses, with many more expected to follow.
Almost overnight, Snapchat has forced some families and lawmakers to reckon with questions that may have seemed theoretical only months ago.
In a letter to the CEOs of Snap and other tech companies last month, weeks after My AI was released to Snap's subscription customers, Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet raised concerns about the interactions the chatbot was having with younger users.
In particular, he cited reports that it can provide kids with suggestions for how to lie to their parents.
“These examples would be disturbing for any social media platform, but they are especially troubling for Snapchat, which almost 60 percent of American teenagers use,” Bennet wrote.
“Although Snap concedes My AI is 'experimental,' it has nevertheless rushed to enroll American kids and adolescents in its social experiment.”.
In a blog post last week, the company said: “My AI is far from perfect but we've made a lot of progress.”.
In the days since its formal launch, Snapchat users have been vocal about their concerns.
One user called his interaction “terrifying” after he said it lied about not knowing where the user was located.
After the user lightened the conversation, he said the chatbot accurately revealed he lived in Colorado.
In another TikTok video with more than 1.5 million views, a user named Ariel recorded a song with an intro, chorus and piano chords written by My AI about what it's like to be a chatbot.
When she sent the recorded song back, she said the chatbot denied its involvement with the reply: “I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't write songs.”
Ariel called the exchange “creepy.”.
Other users shared concerns about how the tool understands, interacts with and collects information from photos.
“I snapped a picture … and it said 'nice shoes' and asked who the people [were] in the photo,” a Snapchat user wrote on Facebook.
Snapchat told CNN it continues to improve My AI based on community feedback and is working to establish more guardrails to keep its users safe.
The company also said that similar to its other tools, users don't have to interact with My AI if they don't want to.
It's not possible to remove My AI from chat feeds, however, unless a user subscribes to its monthly premium service, Snapchat+.
Some teens say they have opted to pay the $3.99 Snapchat+ fee to turn off the tool before promptly canceling the service.
But not all users dislike the feature.
One user wrote on Facebook that she's been asking My AI for homework help.
“It gets all of the questions right.”
Another noted she's leaned on it for comfort and advice.
“I love my little pocket, bestie!” she wrote.
“You can change the Bitmoji [avatar] for it and surprisingly it offers really great advice to some real life situations. …
I love the support it gives.”.
ChatGPT, which is trained on vast troves of data online, has previously come under fire for spreading inaccurate information, responding to users in ways they might find inappropriate and enabling students to cheat.
But Snapchat's integration of the tool risks heightening some of these issues, and adding new ones.
Alexandra Hamlet, a clinical psychologist in New York City, said the parents of some of her patients have expressed concern about how their teenager could interact with Snapchat's tool.
There's also concern around chatbots giving advice and about mental health because AI tools can reinforce someone's confirmation bias, making it easier for users to seek out interactions that confirm their unhelpful beliefs.
“If a teen is in a negative mood and does not have the awareness desire to feel better, they may seek out a conversation with a chatbot that they know will make them feel worse,” she said.
“Over time, having interactions like these can erode a teens' sense of worth, despite their knowing that they are really talking to a bot.
In an emotional state of mind, it becomes less possible for an individual to consider this type of logic.”.
For now, the onus is on parents to start meaningful conversations with their teens about best practices for communicating with AI, especially as the tools start to show up in more popular apps and services.
Sinead Bovell, the founder of WAYE, a startup that helps prepare youth for future with advanced technologies, said parents need to make it very clear “chatbots are not your friend.”.
“They're also not your therapists or a trusted adviser, and anyone interacting with them needs to be very cautious, especially teenagers who may be more susceptible to believing what they say,” she said.
“Parents should be talking to their kids now about how they shouldn't share anything personal with a chatbot that they would a friend - even though from a user design perspective, the chatbot exists in the same corner of Snapchat.”.
She added that federal regulation that would require companies to abide by specific protocols is also needed to keep up the rapid pace of AI advancement.

Title: Trump reiterates threat to retake Panama Canal 'or something very powerful' will happen | CNN
# Trump reiterates threat to retake Panama Canal 'or something very powerful' will happen | CNN.
CNN — .
President Donald Trump reiterated his vow to “take back” the Panama Canal on Sunday, warning of “powerful” US action in an escalating diplomatic dispute with the Central American country over China's presence around the vital waterway.
“China is running the Panama Canal that was not given to China, that was given to Panama foolishly, but they violated the agreement, and we're going to take it back, or something very powerful is going to happen,” Trump told reporters.
Hours earlier, the diplomatic stir caused by Trump's repeated and publicly stated desire for the US to retake control of the canal had appeared to ease after Secretary of State Marco Rubio, making his first overseas trip as the top US diplomat, met with Panama's President Raúl Mulino.
Though Mulino told Rubio that Panama's sovereignty over the canal was not up for debate, he also said he had addressed Washington's concerns over Beijing's purported influence around the waterway.
Panama would not renew a 2017 memorandum of understanding to join China's overseas development initiative, known as the Belt and Road initiative, Mulino said, also suggesting that the deal with Beijing could end early.
Mulino told reporters that Panama will seek to work with the US on new investments, including infrastructure projects.
“I think this visit opens the door to build new relations … and try to increase as much as possible US investments in Panama,” he said.
During the meeting, Rubio told Panama's president and Foreign Minister Javier Martínez-Acha that concerns over China's “control” of the Panama Canal may mean the US has to “take measures necessary to protect its rights” per a longstanding treaty on the neutrality and operation of the canal.
The canal was returned to Panama under a 1977 treaty , which allows the US to intervene militarily if the waterway's operations are disrupted by internal conflict or a foreign power.
Today, more cargo than ever runs through the canal than it did during the years of US control.
Mulino said Sunday he doesn't think there is a real risk that the US would use military force to retake the canal.
Mulino also said Panamanian authorities are carrying out an audit on a company linked to China that operates two terminals around the canal.
“We have to wait until that audit ends before we can reach our legal conclusions and act accordingly,” Mulino said.
The company in question is the Panama Ports Company , part of a subsidiary of the Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison Holdings.
Hutchinson Ports is one of the world's largest port operators, overseeing 53 ports in 24 countries, including for other US allies such as the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada.
As CNN has previously reported, Hutchison does not control access to the Panama Canal .
Workers at their two ports only load and unload containers onto ships and supply them with fuel.
Three other ports in the vicinity of the canal are operated by competing companies providing similar services.
Mulino also said Panamanian authorities spoke with Rubio about the possibility of expanding a migrant repatriation flight program to remove foreign nationals who don't have the legal basis to be in Panama, insisting that the US would have to shoulder the costs.
Asked to clarify if migrants would come to Panama and subsequently be transferred to their respective countries, Mulio said, “Yes.
Exactly …
We can do that, without a problem, under the total cost of the US.
Panama won't invest a single dollar in it.”.
The program, signed in July , is aimed at reducing irregular migration through the Darien Gap, a mountainous rainforest region connecting South and Central America.
The 66-mile (106-kilometer) hike through the Darien brings migrants from Colombia to Panama and is a crucial passage for those hoping to reach the United States and Canada.
Mulino said Sunday that those repatriated could include migrants from Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador and other countries.

# 'There is no future': Even a potential ceasefire sparks little hope in eastern Ukraine | CNN.
CNN — .
Could a ceasefire deal be a disaster for Ukraine in disguise? .
That is the urgent question echoing in Ukrainian frontline bunkers and in the ruins of besieged towns, where ubiquitous exhaustion begs for peace, but where a costly learned distrust of Russia rules.
Anxiety is manifold.
Would a ceasefire hold?
Would Russia just use it to re-equip and attack again?
Would Moscow even want it, given it is fast winning ground?
Would Ukraine's allies give it the same military support, if they felt diplomacy had led the guns to fall silent?.
The screens before Volodymyr Sablyn, a battalion commander in the 66th mechanized brigade, tell a gut-wrenching story of Ukraine's modern, yet archaically brutal battlefield.
Tiny, cheap drones fly over the pockmarked and battered trenches around Lyman - a mix of frozen sludge, trash, bunkers and “beetroot,” the ugly term for human remains that cannot be retrieved.
“If there is a ceasefire now, it will only get worse for us”, Sablyn told CNN this week.
“Because the enemy will restore itself, form new military units, regroup and attack again.”.
Sablyn joined the army in February 2015, when Russian separatists took the Donetsk town of Debaltseve despite agreeing to a truce.
Now, across the eastern front, ceasefires called a decade ago that provided little but cover for further Russian military advances are living proof of the urgent need for caution at the negotiating table.
The scene Sablyn commands is one where relentless Russian assaults and tolerance of casualties has exploited Kyiv's key weakness: a lack of infantry.
As Sablyn's forces drop mortars on Lyman's frontlines, Moscow's forces are advancing on a vital military hub to his south - Pokrovsk.
The pace of its encirclement is startling and, once it falls, Russia will have few major settlements between its forces and the major cities of Dnipro and Zaporizhzhia.
Hope is a key currency here, and one facet of it, consistently raised by Ukrainian officials, is the idea of European or NATO troops providing security guarantees to Kyiv through their specific presence in frontline areas - as peacekeepers of sorts.
A European defense official told CNN recently there were “active discussions” about similar assistance.
A ceasefire, followed by European NATO members manning a de-militarized zone is a key tenet of a peace plan floated by US President Donald Trump's new Ukraine envoy, Gen.
Keith Kellogg, in a policy paper from April.
“If NATO could send troops to Ukraine,” said Sablyn, “it would be a guarantee of security in Ukraine.
Because Russia - no matter how much they say that they are not afraid of anyone - are afraid of America, are afraid of NATO as a whole.”.
Yet as dusk settles near the 66th's forward artillery units, the idea seems beset with insurmountable risk.
The threat of Russian drones is so acute, artillery units can be reached when the sun tips into the horizon, and the light is vanishing.
A unit commander who escorts us checks his handheld monitor to see if the Russian surveillance drones have left.
We pause for 10 minutes until the all-clear is given and then race across the rocky fields to a tree-line where aging artillery guns deal regular “suppressing fire” to the Russians.
Peace is something here you better be deadly serious about, and the men who live underground are skeptical about.
“There is only a 30% chance of a ceasefire,” said one soldier, Viktor.
“Because the situation on the front is not in such a way that we can see that there will be a truce.
It's all very difficult.”.
Another, Andriy, added: “I think it's 40%.
The other side is winning, taking territories.
And we, by and large, have nothing to say.”.
CNN is not including the full names of several people we spoke to, because of security concerns.
The growing candor of troops who would months ago repeat only studied assurances of victory is replicated by some exhausted civilians from frontline towns.
Slowly trudging through the ravaged streets of Lyman is Larysa, 72, her gold incisors bright among the shell-peppered concrete.
“We've been hit 19 times today… 19 times since this morning,” she told CNN.
“My husband is counting, and I'm taking sleeping pills.
And then he wakes me up and says: 'Well, did you count?'
”.
She becomes tearful when asked why she has not left a town first taken in the Russian invasion of 2022, then liberated by Ukrainian forces later that year, and now heavily pressured by Putin's men again, who are about 10 kilometres (6.2 miles) from its outskirts.
“Here, I ran barefoot; there, I swam in the river,” she said, gesturing to the town's edges.
I am 72, I don't want to (leave).
All my three brothers are buried here, all my aunts, uncles, dad, mum.
I can't leave.”.
She has scant sympathy for Kyiv, describing the Ukrainian soldiers she meets in supermarkets as unkempt, and saying a friend's family of seven left Lyman two weeks earlier and were housed in a stable in nearby Poltava.
“A stable!
But it was clean and there was some hay.”.
Larysa said Trump will be no different to Biden, who she had heard on television tried to buy parts of eastern Ukraine for his son, likely echoing false Russian propaganda.
Her hopes are with the Kremlin as the decision-makers.
“Nobody's going to solve this.
Only Putin will if he says, 'that's enough, I've already killed so many people.'
” She nods when asked if peace through Putin is the only path ahead.
Behind her, a bus collects locals who still shuffle in and out of the desolate town to go shopping.
None will talk except the driver, Dima, who says he went to Russia when the Russians first invaded to stay with relatives and recently came back.
He says he is used to the destruction and hopeful for peace.
“It's all politics.
Nothing depends on us.
As it is decided, so it will be.”.
For others, there has been a decade of turmoil and loss.
Inesa, 60, sits alone in the central square of Slovyansk, where 10 years ago Russian proxy separatists seized the local administration building and fought off the Ukrainian army, over repeated ceasefires, deals and Russian advances.
She said a decade earlier, despite the chaos of separatism, they still had jobs and hope.
Now she and her mother are all that remains in Slovyansk, a key Russian target in Donetsk, the rest of her family scattered, she said, across the world by war.
“Now there is no future,” she said.
“We don't see it.
Who does?
I want it just to stop.
Stop the bombing.”.

Title: A photographer's fantastical portrait of rural China during Lunar New Year | CNN
# A photographer's fantastical portrait of rural China during Lunar New Year | CNN.
Editor's Note: A version of this article was first published on February 10, 2024.
CNN — .
In photographer Zhang Xiao's images of the Shehuo festival, an ancient celebration still observed in parts of northern China during the Lunar New Year , rural life comes alive with something altogether more fantastical.
Villagers dressed as cranes, roosters and mythical lions pose for portraits standing amid crops or in fallow farmland.
Costumed performers parade past brick houses against hazy backdrops, the eyes of their masks seemingly lost in thought.
In a harvested wheat field, a group of almost a dozen men line up to hold aloft a colorful dragon puppet.
In his book “Community Fire,” Zhang said he wanted to capture the surreal “disconnect” between people's everyday lives and the mythical personas they assumed.
“Their characters seemed to come from the sky itself, and … formed a huge theatrical stage that transcended the confines of reality, transporting a collective of sleepwalkers to a dreamworld,” he wrote.
“I wandered among them and photographed them quietly, because I did not want to wake them up.”.
Rooted in millennia-old agricultural practices of worshipping fire and the land, the folk rituals of Shehuo (often translated as “earth and fire”) traditionally entailed praying for good fortune and bounteous harvests, or to drive away demons.
Festivities vary between regions but now typically see various performers, from stilt walkers to opera singers, parading through the streets or staging shows.
Today, celebrations coincide with the Lunar New Year, which starts Wednesday.
As such, they have come to encompass many of the traditions — such as temple fairs and lion dances — practiced around China during this period. (Lunar New Year celebrations usually last more than two weeks, with Shehuo festival taking place on the season's 15th and final day.).
Shehuo celebrations have been recognized by the Chinese government in its UNESCO-style list of “intangible cultural heritage.”
But the festival's place in a rapidly urbanizing country remains under threat, said Zhang, adding that most of the performers he encountered had migrated to cities and only returned to their villages for the holiday.
“The significance of traditional customs can no longer meet the needs of modern lives,” the photographer told CNN via email.
“Today's young people are more concerned about the internet and games.
They are not even willing to try and understand traditional cultures.
I think that's sad.”.
## E-commerce and the death of craft .
Hoping to document the festival's disappearing traditions — and the costumes and props associated with them — Zhang spent over a decade photographing Shehuo events at villages in Shaanxi and Henan provinces.
A selection of the images, which were shot between 2007 and 2019, also went on show in the US at Harvard University's Peabody Museum of Archaeology & Ethnology (and over 100 of them were published in “Community Fire”). .
As well as capturing rites, rituals and folklore, the photos speak to the proliferation of mass-produced paraphernalia that has transformed the festival since the turn of the 21st century.
One image depicts a stack of expressionless plastic masks; a set of 12 eerie pictures shows smiling prop heads hanging from trees in flimsy carrier bags.
Several pages of Zhang's book are dedicated to screengrabs of Alibaba-owned shopping platform, Taobao, where Shehuo items can be purchased at bargain prices.
They range from an elaborate two-person lion dance costume, offered for just 360 yuan ($50), to a selection of headdresses priced under 17 yuan ($2.40)..
The rise of cheap goods and e-commerce has been a mixed blessing for these villages.
Some of them — including Huozhuang, in Henan province, which features heavily in Zhang's project — have taken advantage of the opportunity.
The photographer visited and documented several small family workshops that buy semi-complete products in large quantities online before hand-finishing them and selling them on platforms like Taobao for profit.
“In some villages, virtually the entire population has been mobilized to produce and sell Shehuo props,” the photographer writes in his book.
But with economic opportunity comes a loss of traditional skills and customs.
Materials like paper and bamboo have been replaced by cheap wire frames, plastic and synthetic fabrics, said Zhang, who grew up in a rural area of China's Shandong province but is now based in Chengdu, one of the country's largest metropolises in the southwest.
A third-generation prop maker told Zhang that, in the photographer's words, that he “lamented the gradual disappearance of traditional crafts.”
But most of the villagers the photographer encountered were indifferent to the loss of cultural heritage, he claimed.
And while Zhang, as a documentarian, assumed the role of a “quiet spectator” while on assignment, he nonetheless expressed regret at the festival's rapid commercialization.
“People are not focused on how to improve product quality and craftsmanship,” said the photographer, who is currently working on a documentary about life in rural China.
“Instead, they are obsessed with how to manufacture these products as quickly as possible, and at the lowest cost, so as to gain an advantage against the competition.
This has led to a gradual decline in product quality, and the entire industry has fallen into a vicious cycle of price wars.”.

Title: Using Trump's own legal arguments, Pulitzer Board seeks stay of Trump defamation case while he's in office | CNN Business
# Using Trump's own legal arguments, Pulitzer Board seeks stay of Trump defamation case while he's in office | CNN Business.
CNN — .
The Pulitzer Prize board is asking a judge to hit pause on a defamation case President Donald Trump filed against it until his presidency is over, using Trump's own legal arguments against him.
Trump sued the Pulitzer Board in 2022 after it released a statement standing by awarding the 2018 national reporting prize to the Washington Post and New York Times for their coverage of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and its alleged connections to the Trump campaign.
In their motion filed on Monday, the Pulitzer Board pointed out that Trump previously sought stays in other civil lawsuits where he was the defendant, saying the suits should be halted while he is in office because of questions of whether the US Constitution bars state courts from exercising jurisdiction over the a sitting president.
This past Friday, the motion notes, Trump's team requested a stay in a case investors in Trump's social media company brought against him.
In that case, Trump's team argued “(c)ommonsense favors a stay of this case until the end of the President's term,” so that “President Trump can devote his time and energies to America's problems.”.
Trump made the same argument during his first term in a defamation case brought against him by Summer Zervos, a former contestant on his show “The Apprentice.”.
“Specifically, in his first term Plaintiff argued that if a case pending against him in New York state court was not 'temporarily stayed, it will disrupt and impair [his] ability to discharge his Article II responsibilities,' and he declared that 'the effective administration of our nation provides a compelling justification to stay [the] action,'” the Pulitzer Board's motion states.
The board also argues that the stay benefits the president, because the “prize-winning articles concern - and discovery will thus need to probe - Plaintiff's official actions during his first term.”.
For years, Trump demanded the Pulitzer Board rescind the 2018 prize, arguing that he had been exonerated by special counsel Robert Mueller's 2019 report .
The report said it “did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in the election interference activities,” although it did not completely clear Trump of wrongdoing.
Following Trump's demands, the Pulitzer Board commissioned two independent reviews of the awards, issuing a statement in 2022 that read in part: “No passages or headlines, contentions or assertions in any of the winning submissions were discredited by facts that emerged subsequent to the conferral of the prizes.”.
It was that statement that prompted Trump to file his defamation suit against the board, choosing to file it in Florida because one member of the board is a Florida resident.

CNN — .
The return of supersonic travel has been remarkably slow for something faster than the speed of sound, but a major milestone was achieved on January 28 when Boom Supersonic completed its first supersonic flight.
Boom , the American company building what promises to be the world's fastest airliner, broke the sound barrier for its first time with a test flight in Mojave, California.
The company's XB-1 demonstrator aircraft's supersonic flight is the first time an independently developed jet has broken the sound barrier.
The XB-1, which has now completed 12 successful test flights since it first took to the air in March 2024, is the precursor to the development of Boom's supersonic commercial airliner, Overture.
When the XB-1 took off from the Mojave Air and Space Port on its latest flight it was in the same historic airspace where legendary pilot Chuck Yeager broke the sound barrier for the first time in 1947.
The aircraft, flown by Boom's chief test pilot Tristan “Geppetto” Brandenburg, accelerated to Mach 1.122 (652 knots true airspeed or 750 miles per hour) — about 10% faster than the speed of sound — about 12 minutes into the test flight at about 35,000 feet.
The fastest speed the XB-1 had reached prior to the January 28 flight was Mach 0.95, just below the supersonic threshold of Mach 1, which it hit during its last test flight on January 10.
A livestream documented the historic moment for the first civil supersonic jet built in America and the world's first independently developed supersonic jet.
In the control room, 25 engineers reviewed live data during the mission.
The hotly anticipated plane already has 130 orders and pre-orders from American Airlines, United Airlines and Japan Airlines.
It's now almost 55 years since the 002 prototype for Concorde first flew at Mach 1 on March 25, 1970, and more than 21 years since commercial supersonic travel ended with the Anglo-French airliner's final flight in November 2003.
There have been several challengers in the supersonic space while the remaining Concordes gather dust at museums in the UK, the US and France, but so far no one has succeeded.
Boom Supersonic's ambitions remain high.
CEO Blake Scholl told CNN last year that he expects supersonic planes to replace conventional airliners in our lifetime.
“I very much believe in the return of supersonic air travel, and ultimately to bring it to every passenger on every route.
And that's not something that takes place overnight,” he said in March 2024.
Boom's plan is that Overture will be in operation before the end of the decade, carrying 64 to 80 passengers at Mach 1.7, about twice the speed of today's subsonic airliners.
Back when CNN Travel spoke with Scholl in May 2021, he told us his dream was for people to one day be able to “fly anywhere in the world in four hours for $100 .”
In 2024, he confirmed that was still his “north star.” .
The company's plan is for Overture to one day operate on more than 600 routes worldwide.
“A faster airplane is much more human-efficient, and it's much more capital-efficient.
You can do more flights, with the same airplane and crew,” Scholl said.
“We can significantly reduce all of the cost and impact that goes into airplanes by making them faster. if we have faster airplanes, we don't need as many.”.
The XB-1 test craft has been used to prove new technologies developed by Boom Supersonic.
Like Concorde, the XB-1 and Overture both have a long nose and a high angle of attack for takeoff and landing, which interrupts the pilots' view of the runway.
While Concorde dealt with this by having a moveable droop nose, Boom's augmented reality vision system enables excellent runway visibility for the pilots without that extra weight and complexity.
“The advent of digital engineering is a huge enabler for why supersonic flight's coming back,” Scholl told CNN in 2024.
“Aerodynamics, materials, propulsion: Those are the big three areas where we've made huge progress versus Concorde.”.
Back in the 1960s, Concorde was developed in wind tunnels, which meant building costly physical models, running tests, then repeating.
“You just can't test very many designs, when every iteration costs millions and takes months,” explains Scholl.
But Boom has perfected its aircraft's efficient, aerodynamic design using computational fluid dynamics, which “is basically a digital wind tunnel.
We can run the equivalent of hundreds of wind tunnel tests overnight in simulation for a fraction of the cost of a real wind tunnel test.”.
XB-1 is made almost entirely from carbon fiber composites, selected for being both strong and lightweight.
Overture is designed to be powered by conventional jet engines and to run on up to 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)..
We've covered the so-far slow adoption of SAF before here on CNN Travel, and Scholl told CNN last year that he was well aware of its current problems.
“There's not enough of it, and it costs too much, but it is scaling,” he said, but he reckoned that one day it'll be used for all long-haul air travel.
It's the “future of aviation,” he declared.
Construction was completed last year on Boom's Overture Superfactory in Greensboro, North Carolina.
It's been designed to scale to produce 66 Overture aircraft per year.

CNN — .
They call it the Freedom Trail .
A line that snakes through Boston, a walking tour that takes in all the must-see locations where modern America began.
Sure, at just two and a half miles it sounds short, but with so many “firsts” to see, you'll need more than a day to do it justice.
One of those “firsts” is where the Freedom Trail begins.
Boston Common is America's very first public park.
It was first set aside in 1640 for military training and grazing cattle before it became what it is today, a place to while away time and get acquainted with Boston's rich history.
This place is, after all, where you'll find the story of America on every corner, where revolutionary zeal led to the fight for independence from the British.
One of the Freedom Trail's most important stop-offs is the Old South Meeting House, where many of the assemblies of those revolutionaries took place, including one before the Boston Tea Party — a 1773 taxation protest that saw chests of tea dumped in Boston's harbor, triggering a series of events that would turbocharge American independence.
Today you can even head down to the water for a full-scale reenactment, with actors channeling their inner revolutionary and delivering word-for-word speeches.
It's stirring stuff and reveals why it was no surprise that it all kicked off here in Boston.
After all, this was one of the first English settlements in the American colonies, founded in 1630.
And 140 years later, when parliament back home tried to impose a tea tax and a trading monopoly, let's just say things didn't go as the British had planned.
“We look at the Boston Tea Party as the single most important event that led up to the American Revolution,” says Evan O'Brien, creative director of the Boston Tea Party Ships & Museum .
He isn't wrong.
The British viewed the Boston Tea Party as an act of treason and retaliated with punitive measures that would ultimately lead to conflict.
“We were the catalyst which then propelled America into actual war.”.
“There were about a thousand people that night watching the destruction of the tea along the shores,” says O'Brien.
As for “my personal family history.
I'm torn.
I have a lot of English ancestry, a lot of American ancestry.
So perhaps I'd be on the shore watching and huzzah-ing along!”.
There is, of course, a need to stop and eat too.
An apt place is the Union Oyster House , which is claimed as the oldest continually operating restaurant in the United States.
Here you can eat what are claimed as the best oysters in the world, straight from Duxbury Bay, a place with a deep, long history, about 35 miles south of Boston. .
Duxbury is a location that's also pioneering the way towards a more sustainable future.
Shellfish farmer Skip Bennett grew up on these waters and has become the go-to guy for all things oyster.
The delicious shellfish he trades in are a cornerstone of the Boston and New England culinary scene and go back way before the colonists decided they wanted a piece of the Massachusetts pie in the 17th century.
Native Americans harvested the oysters here for centuries, the Wampanoag people continuing to assert their right to do so today.
For Bennett, his farming operation is all part of something bigger.
He has previously dubbed Duxbury Bay as the Napa Valley of oysters and his harvest sells to the very best restaurants in the city.
But, as he points out, his oysters act as a vital filter for water which has been polluted by nitrogen.
Their presence helps to prevent algal blooms and create cleaner, clearer water.
And that's before the economic benefits of having his own hatchery and nursery, as well as staff whose dollars remain in the local area, creating a stronger economy in the process.
This whole place is personal for Bennett, too.
From his oyster farm, you can see where the first pilgrims arrived in “New England” in 1620.
“This is Clark's Island.
It's part of Plymouth.
It's in the middle of Duxbury, in Plymouth Bay.
And it's actually where the pilgrims spent their first Sabbath.
So they came ashore and spent a few days in late December, 1620.
My family settled here and they never left, they've been here ever since the Mayflower.”.
Hang on a moment, is Bennett saying he's a direct descendant of those famous Mayflower pilgrims?.
“Pretty much everybody on the Mayflower!”.
In Boston there's more of those “firsts.”
There's the aforementioned Boston Common and, of course, Harvard, founded in 1636 and the very first university in North America.
And back on the Freedom Trail, the phrase: oldest continuously operating is a recurring theme.
The plaques that mark them are dotted everywhere, even in places like Ebenezer Hancock House, apparently the site of the United States' oldest continually operating shoe store, which opened in 1798 and went out of business in 1968.
Someone strong connections to the Freedom Trail is Paul Revere.
His house is one of the key stop-offs and for good reason.
It was his midnight ride on April 18, 1775, that warned that the British were coming and helped the Patriots win the battles of Concord and Lexington.
Revere's ride was famously immortalized by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow in his 1860 poem “Paul Revere's Ride.”
But while that classic work broadly tells the correct story of Revere's efforts, Longfellow's poetic licence means that a few lines are what might politely be termed fictionalized.
Nina Zannieri is the executive director at the Paul Revere House and is on hand for fact-checking a few lines.
“He said to his friend if the British march by land or sea…” .
“The sea is confusing to people.
We're talking about going across the harbor… to Charlestown,” she clarifies.
“And I, on the opposite shore, will be ready to ride!” .
“Oh oh oh oh stop,” says Zannieri.
“That's the part that we, that is, ugh.
It's terrible!
It's the worst part.
Revere doesn't have to be on the opposite shore waiting for the signals.
He devised the signals!”.
At least, though, Zannieri doesn't mind the final lines.
“In the hour of darkness and peril and need/The people will waken and listen to hear/ The hurrying hoofbeats of that steed/And the midnight message of Paul Revere.” .
The Freedom Trail may only cover a few short miles.
But the stories it helps to tell and the history it brings to life make it something far more than just a walk through a modern, buzzing city.
In fact, for such a small area, there is just so much magic to enjoy and to get lost in, whether it's Boston Common, Union Oyster House, some of America's very best museums or further afield in places like Duxbury Bay.
Remembering every line of “Paul Revere's Ride” is, however, optional.

Title: How to pick a good, affordable college before applying | CNN Business
# How to pick a good, affordable college before applying | CNN Business.
New York CNN — .
Long before you take your high schooler on college campus tours, consider this: Shopping for college shouldn't be any different than shopping for a home.
When you want to buy a home, you come up with a range of how much you can afford and get pre-qualified for a mortgage.
Then you look in neighborhoods that offer homes that meet your family's needs and fall within your price range.
“Adopt a mindset that we're buying college like we're buying a house,” said Beth Walker, author of “Buying College Better” and “Never Pay Retail for College.”.
As a financial adviser and certified college planning specialist, Walker tries to help families avoid a situation that many find themselves in at the 11th hour : Their child applies — and gets into — schools they cannot afford because the schools won't give them enough aid.
And then they just … try to make it work, no matter how much debt is involved for the parents or the student.
Instead, she advises families to start as early as 9th or 10th grade in figuring out what is affordable for them as a family — so parents don't sacrifice their own financial welfare and the future college student doesn't drown in debt upon graduation.
And second, she recommends assessing how a child's talents and interests pare with majors and careers they might want to pursue.
Doing both those things can help you target the right colleges to apply to.
Mike McKinnon, executive director of the National Institute of Certified College Planners, defines the perfect college as one “where a student can go be happy, safe and successful, graduate in four years or less with a marketable degree and little or no debt.”.
In helping families align parents' affordability constraints with their student's academic and social needs, he cautions them not to automatically assume the Ivys or other high-prestige schools will be best simply because of their status.
And he stresses what success in life looks like after college and notes that an Ivy League degree isn't the only path to achieving it, especially if your child won't get much aid to attend.
In fact, said Todd Fothergill, founder and CEO of Strategies for College, a lot of brand-name schools don't even offer merit-based aid, only need-based.
So if you're not rich, but you make too much to qualify for need-based aid, you could find yourself having to cover the entire cost of tuition, room and board every year, which is pushing $90,000 at some US colleges.
Fothergill created a free calculator called CostHero that lets parents assess what financial resources they will have available to pay for a child's college education.
It then provides a range of affordability: At the low end is the number representing what they can pay if they don't take on debt.
And at the high end is the number they can pay if they also take out an unsubsidized federal Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS). .
“If you're not in a position to write a check for $90,000 a year, put up guardrails for yourself so you don't blow up your retirement,” he said.
The calculator inputs let you set the amount of resources you're willing to use to pay for college from your income and savings, your child's earnings from summer jobs, any family gifts, and any federal Stafford loans your child may take.
It also factors in if you qualify for the federal American Opportunity Tax Credit .
That credit, for qualified educational expenses, will reduce your tax bill or increase any refund you have coming.
The calculator also gives you a debt-to-income score like the kind a mortgage lender might use to assess whether you're a good credit risk.
Ideally, he said, you don't want your housing costs to exceed 36% of your gross income and your total debt — including debt from housing, cars, credit cards and any parental education loans — to exceed 43%..
If your DTI ratio is close to or higher than 43% that is a sign you could get yourself into trouble if you end up having any financial problems while your child is in college, Fothergill said.
“If folks have a way to determine the range of affordability prior to the onset of the college search, the outcomes are a lot better.
For example, if one knows that the range of affordability is between $30,000 [a year] with no parent debt and $50,000 with parent debt, then any college that comes in with a net cost in that range is, by definition, affordable,” Fothergill said.
Net cost refers to the true cost of attendance after figuring out how much aid your child may get (e.g., grants and scholarships). .
Generally speaking, the biggest tuition discounts go to the most academically accomplished students in an incoming class.
“The student needs to be in the top 25% of those admitted,” Walker said.
Getting into that top 25% cohort is based on SAT or ACT scores, and having a high, unweighted GPA based on a rigorous high school curriculum.
The curriculum's academic rigor can be further bolstered by taking AP courses.
Since your child is more likely to make the top quartile at some schools than others, Fothergill and Walker both recommend your child focus on applying only to those schools in which they stand the best chances of being in that top group to maximize their chances for merit-based aid.
Otherwise, you'll spend money to apply to guidance-counselor-recommended “safety” schools or “reach” schools with no sense if those places are affordable to you should your child get in.
Using reported data from admissions officers about their key criteria in admitting an incoming class and based on what more than 1,000 schools report about the qualifications they used to grant aid, Fothergill created another tool called ListHero.
It gives students a score that helps gauge how competitive their profile is at a given school, relative to others admitted, and by extension their eligibility for tuition discounts.
Right now the tool is only available to college planning professionals for a fee.
But Fothergill plans to create a free mini-version for consumers to use.
For parents doing their own research on test scores, GPA requirements, costs and aid, he recommends checking the Department of Education College Scorecard , the site CollegeData.com and the College Board .
While your children are in high school they can take other steps to reduce the total cost of their education.
One way is by doing well on the PSAT to qualify to compete for a National Merit Scholarship .
Another is to take AP courses.
If their high school doesn't offer them, there is a program called Freshman Year for Free offered by the Modern States Education Alliance.
It provides free AP placement courses and pays the fee for students to take the AP tests or college-level preparation (CLEP) tests administered through the College Board.
Getting the minimum AP scores a college requires to earn a college credit will lower how much you ultimately have to spend on tuition.
A third option is to see if your state has a program that offers a year of free in-state community college, the credits from which can be transferred to a state university from which your child could earn their degree.
Or, if you plan to go to any other college, make sure the school will accept the credits from a community college course you plan to take.
No matter what steps you take, starting the research and budgeting process early can save everyone a lot of stress, debt and potential heartache in the end.
Said Walker: “We have to be a lot more intentional about this purchase.”.

Title: NASA and Nokia are taking 4G into space | CNN Business
# NASA and Nokia are taking 4G into space | CNN Business.
CNN — .
Texting on the Moon?
Streaming on Mars?
It may not be as far away as you think.
That's the shared vision of NASA and Nokia, who have partnered to set up a cellular network on the Moon to help lay the building blocks for long-term human presence on other planets.
A SpaceX rocket is due to launch this year — the exact date has yet to be confirmed — carrying a simple 4G network to the Moon.
The lander will install the system at the Moon's south pole and then it will be remotely controlled from Earth.
“The first challenge to getting a network up and running is having a space-qualified cellular equipment that meets the appropriate size, weight, and power requirements, as well as being deployed without a technician,” Walt Engelund, deputy associate administrator for programs at NASA's Space Technology Mission Directorate, told CNN.
No less of a challenge, it will need to operate in the harsh lunar environment of extreme temperatures and radiation.
The 4G network unit is being built by Nokia's Bell Labs using a range of off-the-shelf commercial components.
It will be loaded onto a lander made by US company Intuitive Machines, and once deployed it will connect the lander via radio equipment to two roaming vehicles with their own special mission: to search for ice.
One of the vehicles, the Lunar Outpost rover, will explore the area known as Shackleton Connecting Ridge, while the other, the Micro-Nova hopper, will plunge into a crater to scan for unprecedented up-close evidence of Moon ice. .
Images of ice — transmitted back to the lander and then Earth in near real-time via the cellular network — would be a world-first.
Lunar ice could be used to create breathable oxygen, and even fuel that could eventually be used to launch Mars missions from the Moon.
For NASA's Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the moon this decade, cellular connectivity is invaluable.
Currently, astronauts talk to each other by radio, but NASA wants a lunar communications system capable of supporting high-resolution video and science data, said Engelund — especially as Artemis missions become more sophisticated.
“Being able to communicate on the Moon is critical to Artemis — as critical as any other mission element like power, water to drink, and air to breathe,” said Engelund.
“Eventually, this effort will help establish a lunar communications network that could give our explorers the ability to beam scientific data back, confer with mission control, and talk to their families, as if they were walking down the street on their cellphones.”.
It could lay the groundwork for an off-world internet not dissimilar to that of Earth's.
Personal devices could connect to such networks, allowing ﻿space colonists to use smartphones that can access all the apps and services available to those back on Earth.
NASA selected Bell Labs as part of its Tipping Point initiative, a series of partnerships with companies to develop technologies for future missions that puts them in prime position for key roles in the future space economy.
Bell Labs was given a $14.1 million grant in 2020, and in January, Nokia was selected by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to begin working on a communications services infrastructure that will eventually serve as the “framework for the lunar economy.” .
“A future lunar economy will critically depend on communication technologies to collect and analyze data, share information, and maintain and control operations,” Thierry Klein, president of Bell Labs Solutions Research, told CNN.
“This includes sustaining a semi-permanent or permanent human presence on the Moon, as well as automated robotic operations for transportation, resource mining, mineral processing and scientific data collection.”.
There are potential commercial benefits for Earthly business ventures too.
If a network can withstand the journey into orbit, then deploy and endure autonomously amid the vacuum of space, wildly fluctuating temperatures and cosmic radiation, it will be able to survive the harshest locations on Earth — such as polar ice caps, deserts, or offshore platforms.
“Especially when it comes to remote deployments, industrial sites, public safety, emergency response, disaster recovery or defense, it is highly beneficial to have compact, low-footprint network equipment that can be easily transported and deployed anywhere,” Klein said.

Title: What is DeepSeek, the Chinese AI startup that shook the tech world?
| CNN Business
# What is DeepSeek, the Chinese AI startup that shook the tech world?
| CNN Business.
CNN — .
A surprisingly efficient and powerful Chinese AI model has taken the technology industry by storm.
It's called DeepSeek R1, and it's rattling nerves on Wall Street .
The new AI model was developed by DeepSeek, a startup that was born just a year ago and has somehow managed a breakthrough that famed tech investor Marc Andreessen has called “ AI's Sputnik moment ”: R1 can nearly match the capabilities of its far more famous rivals, including OpenAI's GPT-4, Meta's Llama and Google's Gemini — but at a fraction of the cost.
The company said it had spent just $5.6 million powering its base AI model, compared with the hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars US companies spend on their AI technologies.
That's even more shocking when considering that the United States has worked for years to restrict the supply of high-power AI chips to China , citing national security concerns.
That means DeepSeek was supposedly able to achieve its low-cost model on relatively under-powered AI chips.
The company, founded in late 2023 by Chinese hedge fund manager Liang Wenfeng, is one of scores of startups that have popped up in recent years ﻿ seeking big investment to ride the massive AI wave that has taken the tech industry to new heights.
Liang has become the Sam Altman of China — an evangelist for AI technology and investment in new research.
His hedge fund, High-Flyer, focuses on AI development.
Like other AI startups, including Anthropic and Perplexity, DeepSeek released various competitive AI models over the past year that have captured some industry attention.
Its V3 model raised some awareness about the company, although its content restrictions around sensitive topics about the Chinese government and its leadership sparked doubts about its viability as an industry competitor, the Wall Street Journal reported .
But R1, which came out of nowhere when it was revealed late last year, launched last week and gained significant attention this week when the company revealed to the Journal its shockingly low cost of operation.
And it is open-source, which means other companies can test and build upon the model to improve it.
The DeepSeek app has surged on the app store charts, surpassing ChatGPT Monday, and it has been downloaded nearly 2 million times.
AI is a power-hungry and cost-intensive technology — so much so that America's most powerful tech leaders are buying up nuclear power companies to provide the necessary electricity for their AI models.
Meta last week said it would spend upward of $65 billion this year on AI development.
Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, last year said the AI industry would need trillions of dollars in investment to support the development of high-in-demand chips needed to power the electricity-hungry data centers that run the sector's complex models.
So the notion that similar capabilities as America's most powerful AI models can be achieved for such a small fraction of the cost — and on less capable chips — represents a sea change in the industry's understanding of how much investment is needed in AI.
The technology has many skeptics and opponents, but its advocates promise a bright future: AI will advance the global economy into a new era, they argue, making work more efficient and opening up new capabilities across multiple industries that will pave the way for new research and developments. .
Andreessen, a Trump supporter and co-founder of Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, called DeepSeek “one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I've ever seen,” in a post on X .
If that potentially world-changing power can be achieved at a significantly reduced cost, it opens up new possibilities — and threats — to the planet.
The United States thought it could sanction its way to dominance in a key technology it believes will help bolster its national security.
Just a week before leaving office, former President Joe Biden doubled down on export restrictions on AI computer chips to prevent rivals like China from accessing the advanced technology.
But DeepSeek has called into question that notion, and threatened the aura of invincibility surrounding America's technology industry.
America may have bought itself time with restrictions on chip exports, but its AI lead just shrank dramatically despite those actions.
DeepSeek may show that turning off access to a key technology doesn't necessarily mean the United States will win.
That's an important message to President Donald Trump as he pursues his isolationist “America First” policy.
Wall Street was alarmed by the development.
US stocks were set for a steep selloff Monday morning.
Nvidia ( NVDA ), the leading supplier of AI chips, whose stock more than doubled in each of the past two years, fell 12% in premarket trading.
Meta ( META ) and Alphabet ( GOOGL ), Google's parent company, were also down sharply, as were Marvell, Broadcom, Palantir, Oracle and many other tech giants.
The industry is taking the company at its word that the cost was so low.
No one is really disputing it, but the market freak-out hinges on the truthfulness of a single and relatively unknown company.
The company notably didn't say how much it cost to train its model, leaving out potentially expensive research and development costs. (Still, it probably didn't spend billions of dollars.) .
It's also far too early to count out American tech innovation and leadership.
One achievement, albeit a gobsmacking one, may not be enough to counter years of progress in American AI leadership.
And a massive customer shift to a Chinese startup is unlikely.
“The DeepSeek model rollout is leading investors to question the lead that US companies have and how much is being spent and whether that spending will lead to profits (or overspending),” said Keith Lerner, analyst at Truist.
“Ultimately, our view, is the required spend for data and such in AI will be significant, and US companies remain leaders.”.
Although the cost-saving achievement may be significant, the R1 model is a ChatGPT competitor — a consumer-focused large-language model.
It hasn't yet proven it can handle some of the massively ambitious AI capabilities for industries that — for now — still require tremendous infrastructure investments.
“Thanks to its rich talent and capital base, the US remains the most promising 'home turf' from which we expect to see the emergence of the first self-improving AI,” said Giuseppe Sette, president of AI market research firm Reflexivity.

Title: Trump's $1.4 trillion gamble with the economy and prices | CNN Business
# Trump's $1.4 trillion gamble with the economy and prices | CNN Business.
New York CNN — .
President Donald Trump is on the verge of hitting America's three biggest trading partners with sweeping tariffs, a far more aggressive use of his favorite economic weapon than anything he did during his first term.
The looming import taxes on Mexico, Canada and China will be a major test of Trump's unorthodox use of tariffs, which he's described as “the greatest thing ever invented.” .
It's an enormous gamble, arguably a bigger one than any economic policy Trump enacted during his four-plus years in the White House.
And this strategy has the potential to upend the thing many voters care about the most: the economy and the cost of living .
But Trump's tariffs pose a big risk: They could backfire, lifting already-high consumer prices at the grocery store, rocking the shaky stock market or killing jobs in a full-blown trade war.
“This may be the biggest own-goal yet,” Mary Lovely, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told CNN in a phone interview.
“This is a huge gamble.
It's a recipe for slowing down the economy and increasing inflation.”.
The Wall Street Journal went a step further, publishing a scathing op-ed on Saturday titled: “The Dumbest Trade War in History.” .
The op-ed argued that Trump's justification for an “economic assault” on Canada and Mexico “makes no sense” and warned the strategy could end in disaster.
Trump views tariffs as an almost magical negotiating tool, a powerful way to gain leverage over friends and allies.
He has argued that tariffs are necessary to address major concerns, including the trade deficit, illegal immigration and the flow of illicit drugs.
Trump and his supporters often point out, correctly, that tariffs during his first term did not cause problematic inflation.
But those were different tariffs, applied in a very different world at a very different time.
Trump set in motion tariffs on $1.4 trillion of imported goods on Saturday.
That's more than triple the $380 billion worth of foreign goods that were hit with tariffs during Trump' first term, according to estimates from the Tax Foundation.
During Trump's first term, inflation wasn't really a problem.
Today, life is so much more expensive, at the grocery store, at the car dealership and almost everywhere else.
Consumers, investors and Federal Reserve officials are far more sensitive to even moderate price increases now.
The White House has argued Trump's tariffs won't spell trouble for the US economy, but some economists and trade experts are deeply concerned because these levies are aiming at America's closest neighbors, Canada and Mexico.
During his first term, Trump threatened, but never pulled the trigger on, tariffs on Canada and Mexico.
He was talked out of such moves by his advisers.
Hitting Canada and Mexico with blanket tariffs could cause supply chain chaos in the closely interconnected North American economy, leading to higher prices.
“To impose tariffs as high as 25% on our closest trading partners risks decimating the North American economic powerhouse—which the US relies on.
Why would you want to burn your own house down?
” said Christine McDaniel, a former trade official in President George W. Bush's administration who is now a senior research fellow at George Mason University's Mercatus Center.
That's especially true in the auto industry, where parts often cross the border multiple time before a car arrives at the dealership.
Wolfe Research has estimated the price of a typical car sold in the United States could increase by $3,000 due to tariffs.
The oil industry has pleaded with the White House to shield crude from the tariffs because Canada is the largest foreign source of oil.
Analysts have warned that tariffs could increase gasoline prices in the Great Lakes, Midwest and the Rockies.
That's why the White House trimmed tariffs on Canadian energy to 10%, instead of the full 25%..
Grocery store prices are a major pain point that weighed on voters this past election.
But Mexico is America's largest foreign source of fruit and vegetables , while Canada is No. 1 in grains, livestock/meats and sugar/tropical products.
Lovely said she is “very” confident the US tariffs will cause higher prices for consumers - especially at the grocery store and on building materials.
She noted that shifts in the value of currencies could blunt some, but not all, of the price impact.
“It has to increase prices,” said Lovely.
“There's no way you can just levy this tax and then suddenly, poof, this burden disappears - even though that's what he wants to convince us is true.”.
Tariff-driven price hikes won't happen immediately.
Instead, they could play out in a drip-drip-drip fashion as the impact flows through complex supply chains.
“It's not like everyone will mark up their shelves tomorrow, and then it's done,” said Lovely.
“You'll see a slow pass-through to prices.
One week it will be at the grocery store, another it will be at Home Depot.”.
The problem is that higher input costs, along with retaliatory tariffs, could hurt spending by both businesses and consumers - and alarm investors and Fed officials.
Trump's tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China, along with those countries' retaliatory tariffs, could wipe out 1.5 percentage points from US gross domestic product growth (GDP) in 2025 and another 2.1 percentage points in 2026, according to estimates by EY chief economist Gregory Daco.
“Steep tariff increases against US trading partners could create a stagflationary shock—a negative economic hit combined with an inflationary impulse—while also triggering financial market volatility,” Daco wrote in a report on Friday.
A big wildcard is how the Fed will respond.
Although Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues might be willing to overlook a one-time hit to prices, tariffs could force the US central bank to further delay interest rate cuts.
The real key for Fed officials will be how tariffs alter consumer psychology, if at all.
“If tariffs drive inflation expectations higher, the Fed may feel pressured to keep rates restrictive for longer, tightening financial conditions and weighing on growth momentum,” Daco said in the new report.
Of course, it's still too early to say exactly how all of this will unfold.
There are many variables, including how complex supply chains and consumers react.
It's entirely possible that a last-minute agreement is reached before the levies do real damage.
Still, spiking tariffs by this much on this wide a range of goods is a risky strategy, one that not even Trump tried in his first term.
“The administration is playing with fire,” said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM.

Title: This AI technology was supposed to detect guns in school.
Here's what happened outside Nashville | CNN
# This AI technology was supposed to detect guns in school.
Here's what happened outside Nashville | CNN.
CNN — .
A Nashville school district invested about $1 million in AI gun identification software, the school district said, leaving some to wonder what went wrong in detecting a school shooter in the halls.
More than a week ago, 17-year-old Solomon Henderson carried out a shooting inside Antioch High School in suburban Nashville, killing a classmate and wounding another.
Henderson died after turning the gun on himself, police said.
The gun detection system at the school failed to detect Henderson's weapon during the January 22 shooting because he was too far away from the surveillance cameras used to identify a weapon and activate an alarm, according to district officials.
Meanwhile, the system's CEO says the gun could not be detected because it was not visible.
The gun detection technology, called Omnilert, was deployed at all the schools in the district in February 2024 to bolster security, a spokesperson for Metro Nashville Public Schools told CNN.
Using AI technology, the system can identify a gun threat before shots are fired so local law enforcement can respond more quickly, and purportedly, prevent a tragedy from happening, according to the company's website .
But it's only one tool that can be used in conjunction with other measures.
Omnilert's software is relatively new and doesn't work perfectly all the time, according to the company's CEO, Dave Fraser, who earlier expressed his condolences to the school and community.
And while there is no harm in implementing the technology if a school board can spare the cash, gun safety and surveillance experts say there is no concrete evidence gun detection software is effective at preventing school shootings.
Here's how the technology works, what experts say went wrong and whether prevention is possible.
As the constant threat of mass shootings persists, school districts across the United States have invested countless dollars into safety measures to keep would-be shooters out of the classroom - a crime prevention technique known as target hardening.
Gun detection software, like Omnitech, is the latest target hardening resource to hit the market, said Chad Marlow, a senior policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union who focuses on privacy and school surveillance technology issues.
“There's no intervention that is guaranteed to prevent a school shooting.
If so, we'd all be using it,” Marlow told CNN. “
But there are some that may have a positive benefit.”.
At most schools, surveillance cameras are used to keep an eye on any possible threats, according to Fraser.
While helpful, these cameras are only useful after a tragedy has occurred and footage is used to work out how the incident unfolded, he added.
Comparatively, the AI technology used in Omnilert's Gun Detect software is trained to watch surveillance video for weapons in real time, Fraser told CNN in an emailed statement.
These cameras are monitored by AI technology 24 hours a day, seven days a week, he said.
CNN asked the company how many school districts are using the product but has not heard back.
“If a gun becomes visible it is detected in less than a second and the detection information - a picture and a short video of the person with the potential gun, the location of the camera and the building - is sent to a human to make a verification that this is a real threat,” Fraser told CNN by email.
In most cases, the technology initiates an emergency response in less than 20 seconds after a weapon is detected, Fraser said.
Ideally, authorities get to the school before shots are fired, he added.
“At the very least it provides actionable information for staff and law enforcement to help them react to the situation, including knowing the exact location of the assailant,” Fraser added.
For the AI technology to work, the cameras must be able to see the gun - it cannot be concealed.
Metro Nashville Public Schools approved its two-year contract with Omnilert in March 2023, according to Sean Braisted, a school district spokesperson.
Later that month, six people were killed in a shooting at The Covenant School, a private, Christian school in Nashville, about 10 miles from Antioch.
In the case of The Covenant School and other similar shootings, “where the armed intruder came from outside of the building or walked the halls with the weapon brandished,” Braisted said Omnilert's technology “would have been activated and improved police or administrative response.”.
But, in the Antioch shooting, it appears Henderson's gun was not brandished - or at least not long enough to trigger an alert from Omnilert.
“Based on the shooter's position and location relative to our cameras, the system was not activated by his weapon,” Braisted told CNN in an email.
While the gun was not visible to surveillance cameras, Fraser stressed, the system did not misidentify the weapon in this case.
“This is not an issue of malfunction despite the attempts to discredit the functioning of the system or stir up controversy,” he told CNN in an emailed statement.
To detect a gun, the camera must be able to “see” the gun, he said, adding the gun was not visible.
AI gun-detecting technologies like Omnilert have “zero chance of actually preventing a school shooting,” according to Marlow from the ACLU.
“It fails from a technological standpoint, that it's very inaccurate in identifying weapons, and it fails in a practical sense, in that even if it worked perfectly, it stands close to zero chance of being able to get someone to intervene before a tragedy occurs, and that's the big fraud at play here,” Marlow told CNN.
Omnilert's CEO called the fraud claims “counterproductive to the mission at hand which is the protection of our most precious resource: the life of our children,” he wrote.
The main issue with the technology, Marlow argues, is its inability to work if a gun is not visible to the system's surveillance cameras.
In many cases, shooters conceal weapons with a backpack or a jacket, he added.
“The only time that that weapon is actually going to be visible to a camera is when the person planning to use it decides to actually take it out of where it's being concealed from,” Marlow said.
“In most cases, that's going to be done very shortly before it is used.”.
False positives are also common, Marlow said, as these types of systems have been known to misidentify broomsticks as rifles, and rulers for knives.
Omnilert's CEO maintains the system's effectiveness, saying, “Like any system, it is not perfect, and has never claimed to be.
It's also not a singular solution to the challenge of gun violence.”.
If a technology is capable of detecting a gun before it is brought into a school, then it may be an intuitive choice for school districts, according to Marc Zimmerman, codirector of the Institute for Firearm Injury Prevention at the University of Michigan.
“I mean, why not?
Why not use them if they're not too expensive and they can be applied,” he said.
Unlike school shooting prevention measures that are backed by data - such as mental health counseling - there is no data that proves the effectiveness of gun detection software in preventing school shootings, as the technology is too new, according to Marlow and Zimmerman.
Given the lack of evidence, Zimmerman says school districts should focus on all prevention measures available to them and not just one resource that focuses on keeping a gunman outside of a school.
“I would argue that if you're at that point where you're preventing a gun from coming into school, you've already lost.
You've already lost that child,” Zimmerman added.
Fraser agrees multiple protection methods are needed to properly protect each school.
“We always recommend use as part of a layered system which may include human beings, metal detectors and other technologies,” Fraser told CNN in a statement.
How those schools are protected is a decision often made by individual school boards and in some cases, parents.
In recent years, some school districts have invested in installing emergency windows that allow for an easy exit during a shooting.
In Georgia, a panic button system implemented less than a week before the September 4 shooting at Apalachee High School helped notify law enforcement officials of the incident almost instantly.
In the Nashville area, school district director Adrienne Battle said the district will enhance security measures in response to the shooting in Antioch.
“As we've seen a heightened sense around the safety and security in our schools, both with external (and) internal threats, we are continuing to research and study the most evolving technologies that will help us enhance the safety and security measures within our schools,” Battle said in the aftermath of the shooting.
Several safety measures are in place at Nashville schools in the district, including shatter-resistant film or security vestibules at the entrance of a school to prevent someone from coming inside, according to Braisted, who could not comment on the exact security features at Antioch High School.
This week, the school district began installing scanners at the school, similar to metal detectors, which use AI technology and advanced sensors to detect weapons as students walk in, Braisted told CNN in an email Friday.
But the developer of the “cutting-edge” system, Evolv Technologies, has been accused of overpromising some of its safety features.
It settled a 2024 lawsuit with the Federal Trade Commission accusing the company of using “false claims,” including the system can detect all weapons and is more accurate and efficient than regular metal detectors, the FTC said in a news release last year.
Ultimately, parents should also prioritize proper storage of their weapons, Zimmerman added, so their children can't use them to harm their peers or others.
“We have to think about this more broadly,” Zimmerman said.
“There are multiple things we need to do.”.

Title: Spasmodic dysphonia robbed Robert F. Kennedy Jr. of his strong speaking voice | CNN
# Spasmodic dysphonia robbed Robert F. Kennedy Jr. of his strong speaking voice | CNN.
CNN — .
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s halting, gruff speaking voice, which at times can make him hard to understand, has been front and center during his confirmation hearing Wednesday as President Donald Trump's nominee to lead the US Department of Health and Human Services.
Kennedy's vocal rasp is not caused by an infection or respiratory condition.
Instead, he has spasmodic dysphonia, a rare neurological condition in which the muscles that open and close his vocal cords spasm involuntarily, creating a strained or strangled quality to his speech.
Kennedy, 71, has publicly discussed how the condition robbed him of his typically strong speaking voice in his early 40s.
“At that time, I was making a lot of my income doing public speaking, and I could speak to large halls without any amplification,” Kennedy said in a February 2024 interview while running for president.
“When I was 42 years old, I got struck with a disease, a neurological disease, an injury called spasmodic dysphonia, and it makes my voice tremble,” he said, adding that “I think it makes it problematical for people to listen to me.
I cannot listen to myself on TV.”.
Spasmodic dysphonia affects up to 50,000 people in North America, and is a subset of dystonia, a muscle contraction disorder that can affect many parts of the body.
In one type of vocal dystonia called lingual protrusion dystonia, a person's tongue can protrude when they try to speak, strangling their words.
The most common form, cervical dystonia, affects the neck, causing wobbling or worse, the inability to hold the head upright.
Blepharospasm, another kind of dystonia, is a forced squeezing shut of the eyelids that reduces or blocks vision.
Still other types of dystonia can focus on the legs, hands and feet, even the entire body.
While the disorder is relatively unknown, as many as 250,000 Americans have some type of dystonia, according to the American Association of Neurological Surgeons .
It's the third most common movement disorder behind essential tremor and Parkinson's disease.
Dystonia is thought to begin in the part of the brain called the basal ganglia that controls how muscles contract.
When the condition strikes, that signal is distorted, causing muscles to move involuntarily or get stuck in an abnormal position.
Treatments for dystonia are limited.
Some medications can help distract the brain, and those are usually tried first.
Deep-brain stimulation is a last resort for all but those with widespread dystonia in many body parts, which, sadly, are often children, experts say.
Physical and speech therapy are usually a part of the treatment plan; acupuncture and medication may also help.
“A small number of people, maybe 5%, will find that it goes away just like it came, and we don't really know why,” neurologist Dr. Hyder Jinnah told CNN in an earlier interview.
“Most people have it for most of their life once it starts, and so we have to figure out ways to treat it,” said Jinnah, a professor of neurology and human genetics at Emory University in Atlanta.
Injections of botulism toxin relax muscles; it is often the treatment of choice for some types of dystonia, such as blepharospasm.
“It doesn't treat the disorder; it treats their phenomena,” Dr. Andrew Blitzer, an otolaryngologist at Mount Sinai in New York City, told CNN previously .
“We can't change the brain signal coming in to the muscle, but we can weaken the muscle so it can't go into spasm.” .
### Attacks the part of the body used most .
For a reason no doctor understands, dystonia often attacks the part of the body a person uses most for his or her profession.
Diane Rehm, who was a nationally known radio talk-show host for decades and now has a podcast, has a form of dystonia that affects her vocal cords.
“How can you have a disorder where everything about the brain and the hand functions normally except the hand can't perform one exquisite task like writing or playing a musical instrument?”
New York neurologist Dr. Steven Frucht, director of the division of Parkinson's and Movement Disorders at NYU Langone Health, told CNN in an earlier interview .
A violinist and pianist himself, Frucht treats many musicians with the disorder.
Trumpet players will suddenly be unable to use their lips.
Guitar players, writers and pianists will lose control of fingers or an entire hand.
“You would think that this cannot happen,” Frucht said.
“And yet after seeing hundreds of patients, I can say it most certainly can.
And it does.”.
Spasmodic dysphonia, or SD, can dramatically affect the lives of those who develop it, according to Dysphonia International , a nonprofit educational and support organization.
“Many individuals with SD feel that their voices don't accurately portray emotions, personality, and competence,” according to its website.
“Individuals experience physical, emotional, and functional losses including emotional distress, loss of job or salary, forced career change, reduced social participation, and negative changes in personal relationships due to spasmodic dysphonia.”.

# Trump's raids are made for TV | CNN Business.
CNN — .
Every president oversees deportations of undocumented migrants.
But President Donald Trump is producing “deportation TV” - making sure people around the world can see his immigration policy in action.
The administration's immigration sweeps have a made-for-TV feel, as Trump-aligned media outlets have been allowed to ride along with law enforcement agents in recent days.
The actions have a made-for-the-internet feel, too, as officials share photos on social media of deportation flights and border deployments.
On Tuesday morning, for example, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posted videos and photos on X from an enforcement operation in the Bronx.
Speaking like a newscaster, Noem said that she was “live this AM from NYC.”
In a matter of minutes, Noem's videos were the top story on Fox News, the main pro-Trump network in the country.
“President Trump is, of course, a television producer,” CNN's Abby Phillip said on Monday's “NewsNight,” and this is “a story he wants the entire American public to watch: ICE agents in cities near you, outfitted with military-style equipment, detaining migrants that the Trump administration labels as dangerous.”.
Trump administration officials say the X posts and TV programs are, in part, meant to deter people from coming to the United States.
The highly publicized actions are also about proving Trump is following through on campaign promises.
Last week, Fox correspondent Bill Melugin was given what the network called “exclusive access” to an ICE patrol in Boston.
Melugin's report showed federal agents arresting a combative man who said, “I'm not going back to Haiti!
You feel me?”.
The clip generated lots of attention both on Fox and online, and Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, leveraged the moment.
“He's wrong.
He's going back to Haiti.
I can tell him that,” Homan said.
Over the weekend, Trump administration officials arranged another ride-along, that time in Chicago, for the daytime TV talk show star Dr. Phil McGraw.
McGraw, who endorsed Trump during the 2024 campaign, livestreamed some immigration sweeps on his own network, Merit TV.
At one point, he was recognized by one of the men being detained - a surreal scene that Fox subsequently wrote about.
McGraw's TV network did little to promote his “embed” afterward.
But his unusual presence at an ICE raid garnered widespread media coverage elsewhere.
McGraw later told the Chicago Tribune he was there for “transparency.”.
“Transparency is going to be important for people to understand what's going on and what's not going on,” McGraw said.
“I've read a lot of things about sweeping neighborhoods and raiding businesses and even schools and things like that.
That is just absolutely untrue.
That's not going on.”.
As CNN reported this week, some federal agents assisting with the sweeps were told to be camera-ready , with clothing clearly depicting their respective agency.
It all contributes to a “show of force” - a phrase used repeatedly in the news coverage in recent days.
The Trump administration's approach underscores the difference between showing and telling.
While past administrations have employed a wide array of immigration enforcement efforts, and have told the public about it, the Trump administration is emphasizing the “show,” recognizing what voters see and how it makes them feel is politically important.
During President Joe Biden's years in office, right-wing media outlets emphasized immigration-related threats;
“we call it Biden migrant crime,” Trump said on the campaign trail, echoing his favorite pundits on Fox.
Now, with Trump back in office, Fox's fear factor has ratcheted down; the network's shows are parroting the administration's rhetoric about removing “the worst first,” meaning people with a litany of criminal convictions.
Many researchers crunching the numbers have found there's no connection between immigration and crime.
Some have even found that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than people born in the US.
A viral post on the social media site Bluesky captured the left's prevailing sentiment on Monday: “The reality show President is creating mini 'reality shows' to satisfy the voyeuristic interests” of Americans, knowing that “a significant number of people get pleasure from watching others suffer.”.
But over on X, where right-wing accounts dominate, the primary emotion is excitement.
Accounts like @LibsOfTikTok are reposting ICE stats about arrests and expressing relief about criminals being deported.
CNN anchor Kaitlan Collins asked Homan on Monday night about treating the immigration sweeps as “a made-for-TV moment.”.
“We're sending a message,” Homan said.
“It's not OK to be in this country illegally.
It is not OK to enter this country illegally.
It is a crime.
And there's going to be consequences.”.

Title: Dana Reeve grieved some losses before her husband died | CNN
# Dana Reeve grieved some losses before her husband died | CNN.
Editor's note: CNN Films brings the premiere of “Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story” to CNN at 8 p.m. ET/PT Sunday. .
CNN — .
Dana Reeve was devoted to caring for her husband, Christopher Reeve, as noted in the new documentary “Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story.”.
In her diary, Dana expressed a part of her experience that caregivers often hesitate to say out loud, as read by her son, Will, in the documentary.
“I've been studying the difference between solitude and loneliness, telling the story of my life to the clean white towels taken warm from the dryer and held to my chest.
A sad substitute for a body pulled in close,” Dana wrote about caring for her husband after his near-fatal horseback riding accident that left him paralyzed from the neck down. “
The whole man took his last walk away from me five years ago today, leaving only mind, soul, heart and heartache behind.”.
The “ Superman ” actor died at age 52 in 2004 due to heart failure, nine years after his accident, while Dana Reeve died of lung cancer in 2006.
Most of us have acknowledged grief connected to the death of family and other loved ones.
But there is another kind of grief, one experienced by Dana and legions of others, that is less commonly explored among caregivers.
This is the grief one feels when processing the fact that their loved ones have significantly changed, and as a result, their lives will likely never be the same.
This is the grief Dana was experiencing when she spoke about missing Christopher's warm hands or the sailing trips that they could no longer take.
Many hesitate to express such grief to avoid undermining the affection and dedication they feel about the loved one they are caring for.
But failing to express it can have negative consequences for the well-being of the caregiver, experts say, and ultimately stop the caregiver from finding meaning and purpose in the experience of care.
“For so many, there is this feeling of 'Well, he is still here, I should be fine.
I should be hopeful,'” said Allison J. Applebaum, professor of geriatrics and palliative medicine and director of the Center for Caregiving at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City and author of “ Stand by Me: A Guide to Navigating Modern, Meaningful Caregiving.
” “But just because he is still here doesn't mean you aren't sad about the many losses in your relationship.” .
“Giving caregivers the language of grief, and describing what they are experiencing as grief, can be really powerful,” Applebaum said.
“It gives validation and structure to the experience.”.
### Understanding your grief .
In her practice, Applebaum helps her patients better understand which types of grief they are experiencing.
She said there are two types of grief that is experienced before the death of the person they care for.
The first is “anticipatory grief,” which describes the sadness and anxiety about that person dying.
The second is “present-oriented illness-related grief,” which Dana Reeve was expressing in her diary.
Applebaum encourages caregivers to express this grief to themselves, a mental health professional and to others.
Doing so is key to adjusting to life as a caregiver and, ultimately, finding deeper value and connection in the experience.
“I strongly believe as a clinical psychologist and someone who has been in this experience myself, that if we don't allow ourselves to grieve and express negative emotions that bottle up, then we don't have as much access to the meaningful parts of the care experience and the possibilities to grow from it,” she said.
“Grief is a portal to meaning and growth, allowing you to connect to the things that are still there.”.
Caregiver grief isn't usually a one-time experience.
Courtney Martin said she's been “experiencing micro-griefs of the little deaths along the way.”
She's a caregiver-in-residence at The Sandwich Club , an online community and resource for sandwich caregivers , and cares for her father with dementia and her two daughters in El Cerrito, California.
Up until recently Martin has been reading spiritual books to her dad, a ritual that connected her to their long history of talking about sacred practices and the meaning of life.
But one day he told her he didn't want her to read to him out loud anymore.
As a sandwich caregiver, finding time and space to work through such mini-grief moments can be tricky.
But Martin understands that she must find time to process these feelings, otherwise she won't be able to show up for her dad or her kids.
“I cry in my car, and on hikes, and I've gotten into listening to music really loud, which is more a way to express anger and sadness,” she said.
While she does express some of this grief to her daughters, ages 8 and 11, she said she's careful to protect them from the extremes of her pain.
“I want to teach them that the depth of my grief is related to the depth of my love for him.
That is a profound life lesson,” she said. “
At the same time, the depth of my sadness can be so intense, and I don't want to expose them to all of it.”.
Like most things in life, grief is best dealt with through conversation, whether it's talking to mental health professionals, friends or family.
And for many, the first step is coming to terms with the caregiver identity and saying it out loud.
This was the case for Aaron Barnhart, who cares for his wife, Diane, in Evanston, Illinois.
“A big turning point for me came when I was willing to tell other people that I casually knew that I was a caregiver,” said Barnhart, who writes about caring for his wife with Lewy body dementia in his newsletter, The Diane Project.
“One day I was out with my running group and someone asked me what I did, and I realized that I was a full-time caregiver for my wife and I needed to talk about that.” .
“This was after a year of some of the most wrenching changes you can go through with your loved one.
Someone who you have spent so much of your life with begins to change profoundly from cognitive disease.”.
While Barnhart had spoken to close friends and family about his caregiving, there was something particularly healing about being able to say it matter-of-factly with acquaintances.
The self-identifying as a caregiver more publicly led to talking about it more and accepting it more, which, in turn, led to some relief from his grief.
Other caregivers process some of their hard feelings alongside the loved one they care for.
In 2022, Robbyn Washington had an accident that led her to a diagnosis of quadriplegia , which changed her life, and that of her husband, Vince, overnight.
He became a dedicated caregiver, entering “uncharted waters” that have been both emotionally and physically challenging to navigate, even as they both hold hope for Robbyn's recovery.
The Snellville, Georgia, couple found that having regular and honest conversations was an important way for Vince to maintain his fortitude and process his grief.
“One of the things that Vince does well is that he comes to me, and we talk about our weakest moments … and the frustrations we are feeling,” Robbyn said.
“Sometimes we may get angry for no apparent reason, and when that happens, we will sit down and talk through it, so it doesn't have time to fester.
It doesn't feel like therapy, but it really is.”.
One of the biggest barriers to experiencing grief is the sheer busyness of life as a caregiver.
When there is not enough time in the day to take care of basic needs, who has time for emotions?
Effectively processing grief requires bandwidth and time to rest that's only possible if the caregiver asks for help.
“We've found that caregivers' communities are often waiting to help, but people are uncomfortable about asking how they can help or worry that will burden the caregiver,” said Tia Newcomer, CEO of CaringBridge , a social network designed for caregivers to share updates and seek support.
Beside easing the burden, asking for help pushes caregivers to figure out what they need, contemplate what they are going through and even reckon with their own vulnerability in their new role.
“The more you can talk about your need for help and not be ashamed of it, the grief is lessened and lightened,” Newcomer said.
Applebaum isn't just an expert in this area.
She's also lived it.
As she was caring for her own dad, she found that discussing her grief allowed her to find the courage and vulnerability she needed to connect with her father in his dependent state — and connect with herself in her new role.
“It helps to remember that grief is love disguised, and feeling it allows us to connect with the love that is there,” she said.
“Ultimately, we wouldn't be grieving if there wasn't any love.”.
At Christopher Reeve's funeral, his wife, Dana, spoke of this very love, one that sat side by side with her grief.
“I promised to love honor and cherish him till death did us part.
Well, I can't do that, because I will love, honor and cherish him forever.”.

Title: Louvre Museum in Paris opens first ever fashion exhibition | CNN
# Louvre Museum in Paris opens first ever fashion exhibition | CNN.
Paris CNN — .
Throughout his legendary fashion career, Karl Lagerfeld maintained that “Art is Art, Fashion is Fashion.”
But a new exhibition, “ Louvre Couture, Art and Fashion: Statement Pieces,” might just prove the late German fashion designer wrong.
Running until July 21, the exhibition features 45 designers — from Chanel and Balenciaga to Versace and Yves Saint Laurent — revealing an unprecedented dialogue between art and fashion from the 1960s to today.
Seventy garments and 30 accessories by a host of renowned designers are presented in this landmark show — the first fashion exhibition ever staged at the Louvre — with creations often hidden among the museum's nearly 100,000 square feet of rooms and galleries.
While this is the first time the Louvre is exhibiting fashion garments, clothing is omnipresent in its galleries, from Vermeer's “The Lacemaker” to Ingres' nude, turban-wearing “Grand Odalisque.”
What is worn — or not worn — has always been a central component of the creation and reception of art.
“It's very important for the Louvre to continue to open itself up to new generations and to make its own small contribution to understanding today's world.
That is exactly what this exhibition does,” said Laurence des Cars, the museum's president, in an interview at the Louvre.
The collection weaves the threads between fashion and a diverse array of “art objects” — including tapestries, ceramics, portraits, sculptures and the layout of the Louvre's galleries themselves.
Visitors are invited to  flâner — or wander aimlessly, as the French saying goes — through the museum and discover its less popular collections.
“The Louvre is so much more than just the 'Mona Lisa',” Olivier Gabet, the museum's director of art objects as well as the exhibition's curator , said with a smile.
While painter Paul Cézanne once observed that “the Louvre is the book in which we learn to read,” for fashion designers, the museum is the “ultimate mood board,” observed Gabet.
From Lagerfeld to Alexander McQueen, designers have long been inspired by the wealth of collections displayed at the world's biggest museum.
Some, like Christian Louboutin, shared with Gabet childhood memories of days spent in its halls.
Others, like Yves Saint Laurent, were themselves great art connoisseurs and collectors.
For Gabet, the personal relationship between the designers and the Louvre was the starting point for the exhibition.
It's a connection epitomized by the Dior silhouette that opens the exhibition, said Gabet.
Entitled, “Musée du Louvre,” Gabet said that, to his knowledge, it is the “only piece in the history of haute couture to be named after a museum.
The exhibition pays homage to major historical periods, inviting visitors to rediscover the Louvre's artifacts through the prism of contemporary designers.
Highlights include a crystal-embroidered Dolce & Gabbana dress inspired by 11th-century mosaics from Santa Maria Assunta in Torcello, Venice.
A spectacular silk Dior gown featuring a Sun King motif is staged before a baroque portrait of Louis XIV himself.
Iconic pieces such as Gianni Versace's 1997 metal mesh gown — previously displayed at the 2018 “Heavenly Bodies” Met Gala exhibition — are also on display.
The garment took two of the atelier's seamstresses more than 600 hours — or 25 days — to stitch by hand and is embellished with Swarovski crystals, golden embroidery featuring Byzantine crosses and Versace's signature draping inspired by Ancient Greek peplum dresses.
The gown inspired both Kim Kardashian's gold Versace dress at the 2018 Met Gala and Donatella Versace's iconic “Tribute” collection the same year, which featured five of the original supermodels: Naomi Campbell, Carla Bruni, Cindy Crawford, Claudia Schiffer and Helena Christensen.
Sometimes, designers' references to objects in the Louvre are literal.
Karl Lagerfeld's 2019 collection for Chanel, for instance, featured a striking embroidered jacket whose motif is drawn from an 18th-century blue and white chest by cabinet maker Mathieu Criaerd.
Lagerfeld, who considered the Louvre his “second studio,” sketched his initial designs for the dress on a museum catalog featuring the chest, before sending the final version to the Chanel atelier.
Glamour can even be found in the Middle Ages, with armour-style dresses transforming models into modern Joan of Arcs.
French actress Brigitte Bardot was famously photographed by David Bailey in a 1967 Paco Rabanne chainmail tunic, which is featured in the exhibition next to a 3D-printed armour Balenciaga gown.
More often, the broad sweep of history serves as recurrent inspiration for designers, such as Italian Renaissance paintings for Maria Grazia Chiuri at Christian Dior, Medieval tapestries for Dries van Noten, or 18th-century delicacies evoked by John Galliano and Christian Louboutin.
With Paris Fashion Week around the corner, “Louvre Couture” offers a source of inspiration for designers and visitors alike, illuminating the ongoing dialogue between art and fashion.
“The exhibition is not here to say that fashion is or isn't art,” Gabet concluded.
“Fashion is about creation.
The artistic culture shared between great designers — that's the leitmotif of the collection.”.
And this is just the beginning of the conversation.
In March, the famed Parisian museum will host hundreds of guests for the  Grand Dîner , an event that is already being referred to as the first French Met Gala.

Title: The implications of Trump's tariffs for the US housing crisis | CNN Business
# The implications of Trump's tariffs for the US housing crisis | CNN Business.
CNN — .
President Donald Trump has frequently quipped that “we don't need” products from Canada.
That includes oil, autos and, of course, lumber.
“We don't need the products that they have,” Trump said Thursday as he signed executive orders in the Oval Office.
“We have all the oil that you need.
We have all the trees you need.”.
While trees are bountiful in the US (we have 300 billion of them ), economists and homebuilders caution that America does not currently have the industrial capacity to meet the demand and that taxing — or worse, cutting off — Canadian lumber imports could further exacerbate the ongoing housing affordability crisis.
Softwood lumber, which is sourced from the likes of pine, spruce, firs and other conifers is prized for its light weight, workability and strength.
As such, its applications are vast, but it's a critical ingredient in the US homebuilding industry: Commonly, the skeleton and skin of homes — the framing, roof and siding — consist of softwood lumber.
Those bones could soon come at a higher cost, further exacerbating the home affordability problem.
Trump just announced a 25% tariff on practically all imported goods (there was a 10% carve-out on energy imports) from Canada, where the US sources about 30% of the softwood lumber it uses annually.
Trump also imposed a 25% tariff on imports from Mexico and an extra 10% on imports from China.
However, because of a decades-long strife between the two neighboring countries, the tax on softwood lumber might not stop at 25%.
Those imports already are subject to countervailing and anti-dumping duties of 14.5%..
The Trump administration said Saturday that the tariffs were designed to stop the flow of undocumented immigrants and fentanyl into the US.
“Our industry relies heavily on predictability,” said Nick Erickson, senior director of housing policy for Housing First Minnesota, a trade organization that represents builders, remodelers and other businesses in the North Star State.
“Whether it's lumber tariffs or tariffs on any other import, these can impact the supply chain,” Erickson said.
“And we've seen in the past that tariffs on lumber, these are paid for by new homebuyers in the cost of their home.”.
Housing in the US has becoming increasingly unaffordable in recent history, as supply has lagged demand.
And that demand has become increasingly heightened in recent months as hurricanes and wildfires have destroyed thousands of homes across the US.
Compounding that has been a “scarcity and an acute, sustained rise in building material costs,” according to the National Association of Home Builders.
And tariffs would further exacerbate those rising costs, the organization wrote.
Of the estimated $184 billion of goods that went into new single-family and multifamily construction in 2023, about 7%, or $13 billion, was imported, according to NAHB estimates .
Lumber, at $8.5 billion in imports, represents the lion's share of that, according to the NAHB, which noted that 70% of those lumber imports came from Canada.
And it's not just lumber at risk for tariffs: 71% of the imported $456 million of lime and gypsum (which are used for drywall) came from Mexico in 2023.
Factoring in the other raw materials and components imported from Canada, Mexico, as well as China (notably the steel, aluminum and home appliances already subject to tariffs), Trump's new tariffs could raise the cost of imported construction materials by $3 billion to $4 billion, the NAHB noted.
“Which would then make housing affordability conditions more challenging,” said Robert Dietz, chief economist at the NAHB.
History has shown this to be the case.
In 2006, the US-Canada Softwood Lumber Agreement allowed Canadian provinces to collect export taxes on lumber purchased by US companies.
That agreement, which was active until 2015, resulted in softwood exports declining by nearly 8%, US lumber producers gaining $1.6 billion and US consumers losing $2.3 billion, Rajan Parajuli, an NC State associate professor of forest economics and policy, told CNN Business.
“The losers always will be the consumers with the limited benefit for the domestic producers,” Parajuli said, noting that the producers who import the materials end up passing along some of those added costs to consumers.
## Expanding an industry 'takes time' .
While it is true that the US has a lot of trees (about 300 billion of them), economists and homebuilders caution that it would be far from easy for domestic wood to fill the gap.
First and foremost, not all wood is created equal nor suitable for homebuilding needs.
But perhaps most importantly, expanding an industry doesn't happen overnight, said Dietz.
It takes regulatory approval to open a new saw mill, which is necessary to turn timber into lumber.
Timber, he said, has challenges of its own as there are often harvesting limits.
Then there are regulatory requirements to develop access roads.
“At various stages of the production process, there are very limiting factors,” he said.
“That's not to say that it's impossible to increase a domestic industry, but it takes time.
It takes policy refinements, and what we've often seen in the natural resource and construction sectors is it also requires tackling domestic labor shortages.”.
The construction industry has had an ongoing skilled labor shortage for a decade, he said.
“The industry, in any given month, is short about 300,000 workers, and similar constraints apply to sawmills and harvesting timber,” he said.
“There's the economic question of if you're going to increase lumber production or any other kind of building material in a full employment labor market, what other sector are you going to produce less of?”.
A salient example can be drawn from very recent history: When lumber prices skyrocketed amidst a pandemic home-buying boom.
The price of softwood lumber increased from roughly $350 per thousand board feet to more than $1,500 per thousand board feet, he said.
“But when we look at data items like lumber production employment in the sawmill industry, it didn't really increase that much,” he said.
“Part of the reason is that, like any other industry, there's a large amount of fixed costs.”.
Still, even in an era when tariffs loom large, and scores of pressures beset the US housing industry, some homebuilders are optimistic, especially about the potential for the Trump administration to further ease regulations.
“This housing shortage in America has really created this interesting bipartisanship (where all parties) unite on this concept of increasing housing affordability and providing regulatory relief, lifting the barriers at all levels of government for the production of needed new housing,” said Erickson, of Housing First Minnesota.
“This has been going on for about two years, and it's crescendoing.”.

Title: American teens are increasingly misled by fake content online, report shows | CNN Business
# American teens are increasingly misled by fake content online, report shows | CNN Business.
CNN — .
As AI has made fake content much easier to produce, a growing number of American teenagers say they are being misled by AI-generated photos, videos or other content on the internet, a new study shows.
The study , published Wednesday by Common Sense Media, a nonprofit advocacy group, asked 1,000 teenagers aged 13 to 18 about their experiences with media made by generative AI tools.
About 35% reported being deceived by fake content online.
However, a larger 41% reported they had encountered content that was real yet misleading and 22% said they had shared information that turned out to be fake. .
The findings come as a growing number of teenagers adopt artificial intelligence.
A September Common Sense study showed that seven in 10 teenagers had at least tried generative AI.
Two years after ChatGPT's launch, the AI arena has grown increasingly crowded, with DeepSeek's meteoric arrival on Monday.
But the top models are still prone to AI hallucinations, according to a July 2024 study from Cornell, the University of Washington and the University of Waterloo — meaning even the top AI platforms still create false information out of thin air.
And teenagers who encountered fake online content were more likely to say AI would exacerbate their verification of online information, according to Wednesday's study from Common Sense, a media and tech nonprofit . .
The survey also pressed teenagers about their thoughts on major tech corporations, including Google, Apple, Meta, TikTok and Microsoft.
Nearly half of teenagers don't trust Big Tech to make responsible decisions about how they use AI, according to the study.
“The ease and speed at which generative AI allows everyday users to spread unreliable claims and inauthentic media may exacerbate teens' existing low levels of trust in institutions like the media and government,” Wednesday's study said.
Teenagers' distrust of Big Tech echo a growing dissatisfaction with major tech companies in the United States.
American adults also have to contend with increases in misleading or altogether fake content, exacerbated by the erosion of already limited digital guardrails.
Since acquiring Twitter in 2022 and renaming the platform X, Elon Musk has gutted its moderation teams, allowed misinformation and hate speech to spread and reinstated the accounts of previously banned conspiracy theorists, among other moves.
Recently, Meta moved to replace third-party fact-checkers with Community Notes, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg has noted will lead to more harmful content appearing across Facebook, Instagram and its other platforms.
“Teens' perceptions of the accuracy of online content signal a distrust in digital platforms, pointing to an opportunity for educational interventions on misinformation for teens,” the study found, adding that there's also a “need for tech companies to prioritize transparency and develop features that enhance the credibility of the content shared on their platforms.”.

Title: History-making probe achieves closest-ever approach to the sun | CNN

CNN — .
The Parker Solar Probe zoomed by the sun on Tuesday during a record-breaking flyby, coming within 3.8 million miles (6.1 million kilometers) of the solar surface during humanity's closest approach to a star.
The mission operations team, located at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, was able to confirm the success of the flyby Friday morning after receiving a signal from the spacecraft just before midnight on Thursday.
The mission team knew it wouldn't receive any communications from the spacecraft during its closest pass of the sun.
Now, the team members will await more detailed data from Parker about the spacecraft's status that's expected to return to Earth on January 1.
The uncrewed spacecraft flew at 430,000 miles per hour (692,000 kilometers per hour), which is fast enough to reach Tokyo from Washington, DC, in under a minute, according to NASA.
The speedy flyby would make the probe the fastest human-made object in history, the agency shared December 16 during a NASA Science Live presentation on YouTube.
The mission has been building up to this historic milestone since it launched on August 12, 2018 — an event attended by the probe's namesake, Dr. Eugene Parker, an astrophysicist who pioneered the solar research field of heliophysics.
Parker was the first living person to have a spacecraft named after him.
The astrophysicist, whose research revolutionized humanity's understanding of the sun and interplanetary space, died at age 94 in March 2022.
But he was still able to witness how the spacecraft could help solve mysteries about the sun more than 65 years after the mission was originally envisioned.
The probe became the first spacecraft to “ touch the sun ” by successfully flying through the sun's corona, or upper atmosphere, to sample particles and our star's magnetic fields in December 2021.
Over the past six years of the spacecraft's seven-year mission, the Parker Solar Probe has collected data to enlighten scientists about some of the sun's greatest mysteries.
Heliophysicists have long wondered how the solar wind, a constant stream of particles released by the sun, is generated as well as why the sun's corona is so much hotter than its surface.
Scientists also want to understand how coronal mass ejections, or large clouds of ionized gas called plasma and magnetic fields that erupt from the sun's outer atmosphere, are structured.
When these ejections are aimed at Earth, they can cause geomagnetic storms, or major disturbances of the planet's magnetic field, that can affect satellites as well as power and communication infrastructure on Earth.
Now, the time has come for Parker's closest and final flybys, which could complete the answers to these enduring questions and uncover new mysteries by exploring uncharted solar territory.
“Parker Solar Probe is changing the field of heliophysics,” said Helene Winters, Parker Solar Probe's project manager from Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory, in a statement.
“After years of braving the heat and dust of the inner solar system, taking blasts of solar energy and radiation that no spacecraft has ever seen, Parker Solar Probe continues to thrive.”.
Parker's flyby at around 6:53 a.m. ET on Christmas Eve was planned as the first of the spacecraft's final three closest approaches, with the other two expected to occur on March 22 and June 19.
The spacecraft came so close to our star that if the distance between Earth and the sun were the length of an American football field, the spacecraft would be about 4 yards from the end zone, according to NASA.
At this proximity, the probe would be able to fly through plumes of plasma as well as within a solar eruption if one releases from the sun.
The spacecraft was built to withstand the extremes of the sun and has flown through coronal mass ejections in the past with no impact to the vehicle, said Parker Solar Probe project scientist Nour Rawafi.
The spacecraft is equipped with a carbon foam shield that is 4.5 inches (11.4 centimeters) thick and 8 feet (2.4 meters) wide.
On Earth before launch, the shield was tested and able to withstand temperatures near 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit (nearly 1,400 degrees Celsius).
On Christmas Eve, the shield likely faced temperatures up to 1,800 F (980 degrees C), which the telemetry data expected in January will confirm.
Meanwhile, the spacecraft's interior is at a comfortable room temperature so the electronics systems and science instruments can operate as expected.
A unique cooling system designed by the Applied Physics Laboratory pumps water through the craft's solar arrays to keep them at a steady temperature of 320 F (160 C), even during close approaches to the sun.
The spacecraft carried out its flyby autonomously because mission control was out of contact with the probe due to its proximity to the sun.
The immense set of data and images gathered during the flyby won't become available to mission control until Parker has moved away from the sun in its orbit, which will occur about three weeks later in mid-January, Rawafi said.
Just over a year after the Parker Solar Probe first launched, the sun entered a new solar cycle .
Now, the sun is experiencing solar maximum, meaning that the mission has had a chance to witness most of a solar cycle and the transitions between its highs and lows, said Dr. C. Alex Young, associate director for science in the Heliophysics Science Division at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.
Scientists from NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the international Solar Cycle Prediction Panel announced in October that the sun has reached solar maximum, or the peak of activity within its 11-year cycle.
At the peak of the solar cycle, the sun's magnetic poles flip, causing the sun to transition from calm to active.
Experts track increasing solar activity by counting how many sunspots appear on the sun's surface.
And the sun is expected to remain active for the next year or so.
The sun's increasing activity became obvious this year during two major displays of auroras on Earth in May and October , when coronal mass ejections released by the sun were directed at our planet.
The solar storms are also responsible for generating auroras that dance around Earth's poles, known as the northern lights, or aurora borealis, and southern lights, or aurora australis.
When the energized particles from coronal mass ejections reach Earth's magnetic field, they interact with gases in the atmosphere to create different colored light in the sky.
“Both of those storms caused auroras to be visible down to the very bottom of the United States,” Young said.
“But the May storm was an especially strong storm.
In fact, we think it could be a 100- to possibly 500-year event, and that caused auroras very close to the equator, which is extremely unheard of.
It was a worldwide event that millions and, hopefully billions, of people, were able to see, and it may not happen again.”.
The data gathered by Parker Solar Probe could enable scientists to better understand solar storms and even how to predict them, Young said.
“The sun is the only star that we can see in detail, but we can actually go to and measure it directly,” Young said.
“It's a laboratory in our solar system that allows us to learn about all the other stars in the universe and how all those stars interact with the billions and billions of other planets that may or may not be like our own planets in our solar system.”.
With that in mind, Rawafi said he hopes that the sun puts on a spectacular show during the probe's close approaches, enabling scientists to gain insights into the sun's activity.
“Sun, please do your best,” Rawafi said.
“Give us the strongest event you can do, and the Parker Solar Probe can deal with it.”.

Title: Karoline Leavitt gives White House press briefing for an audience of one — with one storyline | CNN Business
# Karoline Leavitt gives White House press briefing for an audience of one - with one storyline | CNN Business.
CNN — .
Karoline Leavitt's first White House press briefing reaffirmed a truism about the Trump White House: His aides perform for an “audience of one.”.
That pithy phrase, portraying President Donald Trump as the viewer-in-chief, was popularized when he first took office in 2017.
Back then, press secretary Sean Spicer tried - and sometimes failed - to impress Trump during televised briefings.
Leavitt seems instantly well-suited to the task.
Several times during Tuesday afternoon's debut briefing, she expertly channeled the president, and she employed many of the same rhetorical tendencies.
Leavitt exaggerated just like her boss; vigorously promoted his executive actions; and demeaned former President Joe Biden.
The briefing was also reminiscent of another 2017 depiction of Trump's communications strategy: a New York Times report that “Trump told top aides to think of each presidential day as an episode in a television show in which he vanquishes rivals.”.
Leavitt brought that type of energy to the briefing room - casting Trump as a savior who is singlehandedly solving the country's problems.
White House reporters speculated afterward that Trump must have been pleased with the nearly hourlong show.
However, many of the questions raised by reporters don't lend themselves to simple answers.
Several of the exchanges on Tuesday afternoon were about disruptions to federal aid programs as a result of an administration order.
As Leavitt ended the briefing, a reporter yelled out, “Are Medicaid portals down in all 50 states?”
One hour later, Leavitt posted on X about the outage and said the websites should “be back online shortly” - underscoring the complexity of her new position.
In the 2019 book “Audience of One: Donald Trump, Television, and the Fracturing of America,” New York Times TV critic James Poniewozik documented how Trump aides and allies learned to communicate with him through television broadcasts.
When Spicer held briefings, Trump “watched constantly” and “had continual notes,” Poniewozik wrote, likening Trump to an “overinvolved network executive.”.
“Spicer never defended Trump strongly enough for his liking,” he wrote.
“Sometimes, he would be passed slips of paper scribbled with a red Sharpie - Trump's writing instrument of choice - and would reverse himself on the spot.”.
Poniewozik also asserted that Spicer didn't look the part.
Leavitt, on the other hand, was practiced and polished on Tuesday, and Spicer cheered for her on X, the social network previously known as Twitter.
The “audience of one” concept applied to other government officials during Trump's first term, too, and it's clearly back in effect now.
Trump poached several Fox hosts and commentators for key positions in his administration, including border czar Tom Homan, who is now a regular guest across cable news defending Trump's immigration policy.
In another Trump-pleasing move, Leavitt also used the first briefing to level some critiques of what she called the “legacy media.”.
She said news outlets have pushed “lies” about Trump and his family and “we will call you out when we feel that your reporting is wrong.”.
Leavitt did not make major structural changes, but she did say that a prime seat in the briefing room, previously occupied by White House press staff, would become the “new media” seat.
She repeatedly encouraged podcasters, influencers and other online content creators to apply for a chance to attend a briefing and ask a question.
Before calling on the correspondent in attendance from the Associated Press, which has historically asked the first question at White House briefings, Leavitt invited two “new media” reporters to ask questions.
First up was Axios co-founder Mike Allen - not exactly a TikTok influencer.
Allen, one of Washington's most plugged-in journalists, was once called “the man the White House wakes up to” due to his influential newsletter.
The second questioner was a Beltway insider of a different sort, Matthew Boyle, Washington bureau chief for the staunchly pro-Trump web site Breitbart.
When Boyle thanked her for welcoming “more voices,” Leavitt pointed to the fact that “Americans are consuming their news media from various different platforms, especially young people.”.
Reporters from digital media outlets have been attending press briefings for years, so the “new media” seat is not revolutionary.
During Trump's first term, Spicer announced “Skype seats” for reporters outside DC, and the press shop rolled TV screens into the briefing room to show video calls from virtual participants.
The “Skype seats” idea didn't last very long, however.
Time will tell whether the “new media” seat becomes a permanent fixture - like the White House press corps who show up day in and day out.
It could easily turn into a spot for pro-Trump commentators and their softball questions.
Or it could be a genuine upgrade to a staid press briefing room.

Title: How an arcane Treasury Department office is now ground zero in the war over federal spending | CNN Politics
# How an arcane Treasury Department office is now ground zero in the war over federal spending | CNN Politics.
Washington CNN — .
A few weeks before Donald Trump was sworn in as president, members of his transition team went to the Treasury Department to talk about the handover of power.
But what is normally a routine discussion turned into an alarming series of interactions for a handful of top career Treasury officials.
Trump's team, which included members of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, peppered Treasury officials about one of the department's most sensitive and critical functions: processing trillions of dollars in government payments a year.
Through a series of specific requests, Trump's landing team attempted to lift the hood on the department's Bureau of the Fiscal Service, an arcane branch that distributes nearly 90 percent of all federal payments, including Social Security benefits, tax refunds and payments to federal workers and contractors.
That adds up to a billion annual transactions totaling more than $5 trillion.
A month later, this obscure Treasury office is now a key battlefront in a wider war being waged by Trump and his allies over federal spending.
Signs of the fight emerged this week.
The top civil servant at the Treasury Department, David Lebryk, left unexpectedly on Friday after Trump-affiliated officials expressed interest in stopping certain payments made by the federal government, according to three people familiar with the situation.
WIth Lebryk out, Musk's DOGE associates at Treasury now have full access to the government's payments system.
According to one person familiar with the department, Trump-affiliated employees had previously asked about Treasury's ability to stop payments.
But Lebryk's pushback was, “We don't do that,” the person said.
“They seem to want Treasury to be the chokepoint on payments, and that's unprecedented,” the person added, emphasizing that it is not the bureau's role to decide which payments to make — it is “just to make the f-ing payments.”.
Before Trump's inauguration, members of his transition landing team wanted to know granular details about the bureau's proprietary computer systems, including “each step in the disbursement process.”
They also wanted to visit field offices where government workers, in Philadelphia or Kansas, work on computers that disburse payments.
The requests puzzled many career officials initially.
The transition operation hadn't requested substantive briefings on any of Treasury's other critical areas of operation, multiple people familiar with the matter said.
Veterans of past transition efforts, representing presidents of both parties, couldn't recall precedent for the Trump team's entreaty.
The arcane process of cutting the government's checks is normally overlooked by political leadership, though the incoming administration exhibited an odd interest in its inner workings, sources said — raising suspicions among career officials about the intent to tinker with a crucial financial pipeline that keeps the nation's economy running.
Tension between Lebryk and Trump political appointees, including those affiliated with DOGE, had been mounting, with sources telling CNN that things escalated this week after the Office of Management and Budget on Monday ordered a sweeping freeze on trillions of dollars in federal spending.
At the time, Lebryk was the acting Treasury Secretary.
Trump's pick to lead Treasury, Scott Bessent, was sworn in Tuesday.
OMB rescinded that order a few days later after an uproar that's still being litigated in court.
Lebryk's departure, which he announced by email to his team on Friday morning, has shaken up career Treasury officials, several sources have told CNN this week.
With Lebryk gone, Bessent signed off on access to the payments system for the DOGE team detailed to Treasury by Friday evening.
DOGE officials, in the lead up to Bessent's decision to sign-off on their access, had been operating from the position that Trump's Inauguration Day executive order establishing their agency had already authorized their access.
That order, in part, directs the heads of federal agencies to take “all necessary steps” within the law to ensure Musk's group has “full and prompt access to all unclassified agency records, software systems, and IT systems.”.
Lebryk's exit was first reported by the Washington Post, but the full scale of the tension inside the Treasury Department has not been previously reported.
Lebryk didn't respond to an inquiry from CNN on Friday morning.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, called for an investigation on Friday following news of Lebryk's departure.
“It's alarming that Elon Musk is attempting to gain access to the Federal Government's critical payment system, which is responsible for delivering Social Security checks, tax refunds, and Medicare benefits to Americans across the country,” Warren said in a statement provided to CNN.
“It is equally alarming that Musk and the Trump Administration drove out the most senior career official at Treasury as the agency is already taking extraordinary measures to avoid a US default.”.
Multiple Trump administration officials, including people at Treasury, didn't respond to several requests for comment this week.
Musk himself acknowledged his interest in the Treasury Department's payment processing in a middle-of-the-night post on his social media platform Saturday.
He wrote his team “discovered, among other things, that payment approval officers at Treasury were instructed always to approve payments, even to known fraudulent or terrorist groups.
They literally never denied a payment in their entire career.
Not even once.”.
The post appeared to ignore the mechanisms already in place for Treasury to simply fulfill lawful payment decisions made by other agencies, and that the system's value to the federal bureaucracy and the nation's economy lies in its reliability.
Jack Lew, who ran the Treasury Department during President Barack Obama's second term, said any attempt to disrupt payments made by the BFS would be dangerous to the world's markets.
“The American people should not have to worry about political interference when it comes to receiving Social Security and other payments the fiscal service makes,” Lew told CNN.
“And as the world's reserve currency, it is crucial to maintain confidence around the globe that the US Government will make timely payments on its obligations.”.
Some of the members of Trump's landing team present for the initial transition meetings are now working at the Treasury Department.
Among them is Baris Akis, a Musk ally who is the co-founder of a venture capital firm, Human Capital.
Akis' presence raised alarms among some of the Treasury officials present for those early meetings, since he was not an official member of the incoming Trump administration and didn't have a security clearance at the time, the sources told CNN.
Akis, along with a few others affiliated with Musk's DOGE, has been in the Treasury building in recent days.
Sources familiar with the department tell CNN they “rove around as a pack” — emphasizing how the group is working in the building in a way that is separate from the rest of the department's staff.
Akis did not respond to a request for comment from CNN.
Meanwhile, several blocks away in downtown Washington, Musk has asserted significant influence at the Office of Personnel Management, with at least one other employee formerly with Human Capital.
The agency, which serves as the overarching human resources headquarters for the federal government, has historically been an operation driven by career officials who have worked across administrations of both parties.
Political appointees have long played a role, but according to one long-time official, the current iteration “is like a different world.”.
That world is now populated with a number of Musk acolytes.
Amanda Scales, who previously worked for Musk's artificial intelligence company xAI after working for Human Capital, arrived at OPM as the agency chief of staff on Inauguration Day and has been the central figure identified with the agency's sweeping efforts to restructure the federal workforce, multiple agency officials said.
She previously worked at Akis' company.
Brian Bjelde, the human resources chief for SpaceX, and Anthony Armstrong, a Morgan Stanley banker who worked on Musk's purchase of Twitter, have also taken on substantial roles.
Musk worked out of the OPM headquarters - with his surrogates by his side - last week, the officials said.
Trump's nominee to run OPM, Scott Kupor, is awaiting confirmation but also holds deep ties to the Silicon Valley universe integral to Musk's DOGE operations.
Nonprofits and Democrat-led states are already suing to try to block the Trump administration's attempts to freeze federal spending.
Despite the rescission of the memo directing the pause, they say the lawsuits need to continue, because of evidence the funding is being withheld.
On Friday, a federal judge in Rhode Island told the Trump administration it couldn't block payments to states, nor could it try to revive stopping payments in any agency under Trump.
More hearings are to come, including on Monday morning in a separate federal court, in DC.
The court fights show how any action by the administration that tampers with congressionally mandated funding could attract aggressive litigation.
The lawsuits haven't yet touched upon the Bureau of the Fiscal Service's work inside the Treasury Department.

Title: Tariffs guide: How much you'll pay, and when Trump will put them in place | CNN Business
# Tariffs guide: How much you'll pay, and when Trump will put them in place | CNN Business.
CNN — .
President Donald Trump says he will impose his tariffs over the weekend, gambling that taxing American companies for imported goods will ultimately punish the countries that make stuff Americans want — and bring those nations to the negotiating table.
But it's a risky bet that could easily backfire on American consumers and the economy.
In the United States, tariffs typically serve a limited but important purpose: They are intended to grow America's economy by incentivizing the purchase of made-in-the-USA goods.
They accomplish that by effectively penalizing American companies that buy foreign goods with high taxes.
Economists largely believe that, in limited circumstances, tariffs can be effective tools for economic growth.
But Trump believes that tariffs have an altogether different purpose.
Trump has long praised tariffs as effective economic policy.
On Monday, Trump called “tariff” the fourth-most beautiful word in the dictionary, behind “God,”
“love” and “religion.”.
And Trump has repeatedly (and incorrectly) said that “the tariff sheriff,” former President William McKinley, ushered in an era of American prosperity at the end of the 19th century by going all-in on tariffs.
Though the US economy was growing strong in the 1890s, that was largely on the back of practically unrestricted immigration, among other factors.
Still, Trump has used and promised to employ tariffs for three primary purposes: to raise revenue, to bring trade into balance and to bring rival countries to the negotiating table.
America is running massive deficits, and Trump's tax cut plan could put the budget even deeper in the hole.
Trump has said the tariffs will make up for lost revenue: He predicted last week in a keynote address to the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum that the tariffs would bring in hundreds of billions of dollars — perhaps trillions of dollars — into the US Treasury.
Trump routinely criticizes American trade policy for “subsidizing” Canada and Mexico, saying America is “losing” hundreds of billions of dollars to its neighboring nations.
Trump is imprecisely talking about the trade gap , the difference between what America exports and imports.
Some economists caution that Trump's language about America's trade gap presents an unfair representation of what has become a crucial mechanism for the US economy — its ability to purchase services offered by other countries as well as stuff that isn't made here much, like coffee.
And Trump likes tariffs because they can force countries to give up something he believes is in America's best interest.
Although tariffs are charged to importers, they can dissuade buyers from purchasing goods from tariffed countries, hurting those nations' economies.
That has led some of them to seek agreements to avoid tariffs.
Trump has said he wants Canada and Mexico to stop the flow of undocumented immigrants and illegal drugs into the United States.
And for China, Trump has said tariffs would be aimed at forcing the country to make good on what he said was a stated promise to him that the government would execute people caught sending fentanyl to the United States.
Trump and his administration have been consistent: Tariffs in some form are coming on Saturday.
But they've offered conflicting information about what tariffs would be announced this weekend.
During an Oval Office signing ceremony on his first day in office, Trump said he would impose 25% across-the-board tariffs on Mexico and Canada on February 1.
The next day he said he would place a 10% tariff on all goods from China on February 1.
Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reiterated Wednesday that February 1 was when tariffs would go into effect.
And again on Thursday from the Oval Office, Trump said his administration will be announcing 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico Saturday.
Friday, Leavitt rebutted a Reuters report that suggested tariffs could be delayed, stating that 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico and 10% tariffs on China would be put in place Saturday.
But Trump at an address to House Republicans on Monday spelled out specific items that his administration would tariff — rather than across-the-board tariffs — including pharmaceuticals, microchips and steel.
Confusingly, earlier that day, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was pushing for a plan to begin with a 2.5% tariff on all goods and gradually increase them, according to the Financial Times .
But Trump told reporters on Air Force One that he would reject that plan, saying “that would not be acceptable to me,” saying tariffs needed to be “much, much bigger.” .
There's widespread doubt on Wall Street that Trump will rush to put into effect those massive tariffs in full force on Saturday.
To enact tariffs, Trump will probably declare a national economic emergency, invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, known as “IEEPA,” which unilaterally authorizes a president to manage imports during a national emergency, CNN has previously reported .
But Chris Krueger, an analyst at TD Securities, noted that Trump has not yet triggered the IEEPA statute and is running out of time to get that done for Saturday's promised tariffs.
If not Saturday — or if some limited tariffs go in place Saturday — more severe tariffs could be put in place later this year.
Trump's pick for Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, hinted at a second wave of tariffs against Mexico and Canada that could come in the spring — perhaps April.
He suggested that the initial tariffs, coming as soon as Saturday, are “action-oriented” tariffs aimed at reducing fentanyl and illegal immigrants coming over the US border.
And he said those action-oriented tariffs may be avoided altogether: “As far as I know, they are acting swiftly, and if they execute it, there will be no tariff,” Lutnick said Wednesday at his confirmation hearing.
“And if they don't, then there will be.”.
Canada has been hoping to avoid tariffs by doing just that, working with the United States and pledging Wednesday to stand up a “strike force”on fentanyl to hit drug traffickers “harder and faster,” deploying two Black Hawk helicopters, 60 drones and new specially trained canine teams at the border.
Canada's foreign affairs minister Mélanie Joly said Wednesday she was hopeful to avoid tariffs after her meeting with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, but she acknowledged that no one knows what will happen February 1 — only the president, she said.
But Canada is also preparing to retaliate against tariffs, if necessary.
Canadian officials are working on a list of dozens of American products that the United States exports to Canada, targeting items that both send a political message and inflict a reasonable amount of economic damage, two sources said, including ceramic products, steel products, furniture, certain alcoholic beverages like Bourbon and Jack Daniels whiskey, orange juice and pet food, among other goods.
The second kind of tariff, which Lutnick said would be “ordinary tariffs,” could be executed after a study on the macroeconomic effects of levying import taxes on America's neighbors.
That study will be concluded by April, as mandated by an executive order Trump signed on his first day in office, Lutnick said.
Trump has also proposed 10% tariffs on all other goods coming into America, though he said last week his administration wasn't ready to implement those just yet.
And he proposed tariffs on Denmark to incentivize it to give control of Greenland to the United States. (He has also threatened to use military force to take Greenland.) Trump on Thursday said that goods from BRICS nations — a coalition of emerging economies backed by China and Russia — would face 100% tariffs if they attempted to move away from the US dollar in international trade.
Importantly, Trump has a history of threatening tariffs, only to later rescind them.
Last week, for example, he announced steep tariffs on Colombia in retaliation for failing to accept US miliary planes with deportees.
Ten hours later, he said the tariffs would not go in place after Colombia reversed its stance.
In 2019, Trump threatened a 5% tariff on all Mexican imports that would rise to 25% if Mexico declined to take action to reduce the number of undocumented immigrants crossing the border with the United States.
But after Mexican officials traveled to Washington for a week of in-person negotiations — and an agreement was reached to reinstate the “Remain in Mexico” immigration policy — the tariffs were never implemented.
If Trump follows through with limited tariffs, he has said they'd be focused on pharmaceuticals, steel and computer chips.
Trump on Thursday said oil might not be part of any tariffs on Mexico and Canada, and his administration would make that determination as early as Thursday night.
But if tariffs are broader, that could raise prices on many common purchases, because Mexico, China and Canada are America's top trading partners.
Some prices could rise quite quickly.
For example, because most American cars are partially made in Mexico and Canada, the tariffs would add a minimum of thousands of dollars to the cost of cars, according to experts.
Gas, food and alcohol prices would also rise if Trump imposed Canadian and Mexican tariffs.
Sneaker prices would rise if Trump raised tariffs on China: About 99% of shoes sold in the United States are imported, mostly from China, according to the Footwear Distributors & Retailers of America, a trade group that represents Nike, Steve Madden, Cole Haan and other footwear brands.
America also gets the vast majority of its electronics from there.
Tariffs in certain circumstances do not cause inflation problems.
Trump's first-term tariffs did not meaningfully raise inflation, although they were far narrower in scope than what Trump is currently proposing, and the pandemic that follow skewed some of the inflationary aspects of the tariffs — many of which remained in place during the Biden administration.
But mainstream economists largely agree that tariffs cause inflation.
That's because importers — not the countries exporting the goods — pay the tax, and they typically pass that cost on to consumers in the form of higher prices.
New research from the Peterson Institute for International Economics suggests Trump's aggressive tariff campaign will force American consumers to pay more for practically everything — from foreign-made sneakers and toys to food.
They also can lead to trade wars.
China, Europe and Canada, for example, retaliated against America with their own tariffs on particular items after the first Trump administration levied tariffs on certain items from those nations.
Trump's proposed tariffs could add $272 billion a year to tax burdens, according to Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Corpay Cross-Border Solutions.
The Peterson Institute has estimated Trump's proposed tariffs would cost the typical US household over $2,600 a year. .
Still, some proponents of Trump's plan say the risk is worth the reward.
Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, last week told CNBC that if tariffs cause a little inflation but address a national security issue, then people should “get over it.” .
Lutnick echoed those remarks Wednesday.
“If Canada is going to rely on America for its economic growth, how about you treat our farmers, our ranchers and our fishermen with respect?” he said.
“And so I think the president and our Trump administration is focused on improving the lives of our producers.”.
In the end, Lutnick argued tariffs mean “the economy of the United States will be much, much better.”.

CNN — .
New insights into bee movements and life cycles have been uncovered after researchers tracked the insects using tiny QR codes glued onto their backs.
By recording when bees entered and exited their hives, scientists from Penn State University (PSU) discovered that, while most journeys last only a few minutes, a minority of bees can spend up to two hours outside the hive foraging for food, according to a statement from the university last week.
“This suggests that most of the foraging that the bees do occurs very close to the hive,” study co-author Margarita López-Uribe, an associate professor of entomology at PSU, told CNN on Monday.
As well as foraging, bees who go on longer journeys may simply be exploring, while others may never return to the colony, said López-Uribe.
Bees are commonly believed to live for around 28 days, explained Robyn Underwood, Penn State Extension educator in apiculture and co-author on the paper.
However, the data suggests that bees have longer lives than previously thought.
“We're seeing bees foraging for six weeks, and they don't start foraging until they are already about two weeks old, so they live a lot longer than we thought,” said Underwood in the statement.
The team, made up of entomologists and electrical engineers, attached AprilTags, a kind of QR code that is smaller than the nail on your little finger, to the bees using glue.
López-Uribe said this “took a lot of practice” to get right.
“If you don't add enough the bees can remove the tag, but if you add too much you can get glue all over the bees' bodies,” she said.
They then used an automated imaging system to monitor bees' movements through a customized hive entrance 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and the use of affordable equipment allowed the team to track more than 32,000 bees.
This method expands on conventional entomological field work practices, which rely on human observations over limited periods, said researchers, who hope that their method will be used by other entomologists.
“One of the goals of developing this system open-access and with low-cost equipment was to be able to transfer this method to be replicated across dozens (or hundreds) of landscapes,” said López-Uribe.
Researchers are aiming to work out how far bees will fly from the hive to forage for food, if there are enough food sources nearby.
“The underlying assumption of the study is that if hives are placed in areas with enough high-quality food, they will tend to forage close to the colonies, meaning that beekeepers could 'limit' the foraging area of bees,” said López-Uribe.
The ultimate aim is to use this data to bring strengthen organic beekeeping standards in the United States.
Current standards stipulate that colonies must be placed in areas that are pesticide-free within a 5-kilometer (3.1-mile) radius, she added.
The paper was published in the journal HardwareX .

Title: Welcome to tax season.

# Welcome to tax season.
What to know before you file | CNN Business.
CNN — .
Monday marks the first day that the IRS will start accepting and processing 2024 income tax returns.
So whether you're in a rush to get your refund or just wondering how long you can postpone sending your return in, here's what you need to know and some tips to make doing your taxes a little easier.
The official IRS filing and payment deadline this year is April 15, unless you:.
Live in a federally declared disaster area: For residents and businesses in such areas, the IRS typically grants extensions for both filing and paying income taxes, plus any other federal tax obligations you may have in a given period. (Specific relief notices by disaster area can be found here on the IRS Web site.) For example, the IRS pushed the tax filing and payment deadlines to October 15 for those in counties affected by the Los Angeles area wildfires .
Can't or don't want to file by April 15: That is okay so long as you apply for an automatic six-month extension by that date.
That kind of extension, however, is simply an extension to file your 2024 return, but not an extension to pay what you owe.
If you owe any money to the IRS for tax year 2024, April 15 is still your payment deadline.
The IRS Direct File program , which lets eligible taxpayers file their taxes directly with the IRS for free, is now available in 25 states, up from 12 last year when the agency piloted the program.
The states are: Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington State, Wisconsin and Wyoming.
In addition, the IRS is partnering with certain private-sector tax preparation software firms that will let you file for free if you qualify.
Generally speaking, it is only for filers whose adjusted gross income is $84,000 or less.
Beyond that each of the private-sector partners has its own eligibility criteria based on factors such as age, income and state residency, but all offer “active-duty military personnel with an AGI of $84,000 or less in 2024, free tax preparation and filing using IRS Free File,” according to the IRS.
Your prior year return will give you a good starting point for figuring out what documents you need to have handy to fill out your 2024 return, said Tom O'Saben, director of tax content and government relations at the National Association of Tax Professionals.
Got married or divorced?
Had a baby?
Started a side gig for more income?
Sold a home or other big investment?
Started receiving Social Security or inherited IRA payments?
Lost a job and collected unemployment benefits?.
Big life transitions and income changes may have a direct effect on your tax liability — including the tax breaks you can take, and the size of your refund — or the amount of additional tax you will owe.
While you may receive paper versions of 2024 tax documents, others may only be delivered electronically.
So check your mailbox, your email and your relevant online accounts to ensure you have received all the W2s, 1099s, donation receipts and any other income tax information forms you will need from your banks, brokerages, employers, favorite charities, etc.
If you were paid for goods and services you provided through payment apps or via online marketplaces like Venmo, CashApp, Airbnb and Etsy, you may be getting a 1099-K reporting your transactions if, combined, they exceeded $5,000 for the year. (The old threshold used to be $20,000.).
You might also get a 1099-K if those combined transactions were less than that, especially if you live in Maryland, Massachusetts, Vermont or Virginia, where the reporting threshold is set at $600.
If you get a 1099-K in error — e.g., the form includes transactions that were personal in nature — check this IRS document for some tips on how to correct the situation.
But, generally speaking, the IRS expects you to report all the 1099-K information you receive on your 2024 return.
Then adjust for any errors either on that return using Schedule 1 or via an amended return after you filing your original by your filing deadline (which you should do to avoid penalties if you owe money ). .
If you purchased an electric vehicle, that qualifies for the clean vehicle energy credit or used clean vehicle credit.
Your dealer should send both you and the IRS a Form 15400, known as a Clean Vehicle Seller Report .
Information from it should be reported on your return to help you claim or reconcile the credit your claim on your return, according to NATP.
## Separate chatter from reality on the state and local tax deduction .
There is a lot of talk about increasing the state and local tax deduction.
None of it applies to your 2024 tax return.
Lawmakers may change the deduction going forward but for now it is still capped at $10,000.
So, if you are itemizing your deductions or calculating whether it's worth doing so — which it would be if all your itemized deductions combined exceed your standard deduction — then you will only be able to deduct up to $10,000 for the state and local income, property and sales taxes you paid last year.
The only real reason most people are eager to file their return is if they're owed a refund.
The majority of all US tax filers typically do get a refund, which the IRS usually issues within 21 days of accepting your return.
But the agency notes on its site that if you are claiming an Earned Income Tax Credit, the IRS cannot by law issue the EITC-related refund before mid-February.
To track the status of your refund after you file, you can use the agency's Where's My Refund tool.

Title: Key exercises you should perform as you age | CNN
# Key exercises you should perform as you age | CNN.
Editor's note: Dana Santas, known as the “ Mobility Maker ,” is a certified strength and conditioning specialist and mind-body coach in professional sports, and is the author of the book “Practical Solutions for Back Pain Relief.” .
CNN — .
As you age, your body undergoes changes that can significantly affect your ability to move.
Among the most impactful are muscle loss, joint deterioration and decreased bone density — issues that can lead to reduced mobility, chronic pain and an increased risk of fractures.
These challenges are particularly pronounced in menopausal and postmenopausal women , but they also affect aging men, especially those leading sedentary lifestyles.
That's the bad news about getting older.
But the good news is that by incorporating specific types of exercise into a consistent workout routine, you can proactively counter these age-related declines and maintain an active lifestyle and higher quality of life well into your later years.
Sarcopenia : As you get older, your muscles naturally begin to lose mass and strength in a process known as sarcopenia.
This decline typically starts around the age of 30 and accelerates after the age of 60 .
The loss of muscle mass can make daily activities more challenging and increase the risk of falls and injuries.
Maintaining muscle strength is essential for mobility, balance and overall functional independence.
“After the age of 50, women lose 8% of their muscle mass yearly,” said Dr. Stephanie Faubion, coauthor of a December 2024 study published in the journal Menopause and medical director of Mayo Clinic's Center for Women's Health.
“And because muscles burn calories, the loss of muscle contributes to weight gain as women age and don't necessarily adjust their caloric intake or exercise regimen.” .
Joint deterioration: Aging also takes a toll on our joints.
Over time, the cartilage that cushions our joints can wear down, leading to pain and immobility.
Maintaining joint health is crucial for preserving range of motion and preventing discomfort that can limit activity.
“Joint aches are one of the biggest complaints of menopausal women,” Faubion noted.
“It seems to be related to the loss of estrogen, contributing to muscle loss .” .
Bone density loss: Bone density naturally decreases with age, increasing the risk of fractures and osteoporosis, especially in women after menopause due to the drop in estrogen levels.
Osteoporosis, a condition characterized by weak and brittle bones, becomes a significant concern for both women and men, particularly those leading sedentary lifestyles .
A common misconception is that bone density preservation is only tied to lifting weights, according to Faubion.
She pointed to how astronauts lost bone density due to the loss of gravity, saying, “it's weight-bearing exercises, not weight-lifting exercises, that are most effective at building bone density.”.
To maintain physical fitness, aging adults need to meet the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity weekly and two days per week of muscle-strengthening activities of moderate intensity that involve all of the major muscle groups.
To counteract age-related changes effectively, those minutes need to include a variety of exercises that build strength, enhance mobility, improve balance and increase cardiovascular health.
Incorporate these types of exercise into your routine:.
1. Resistance training: Resistance training is the key to combating muscle loss.
It can include weight lifting , resistance band exercises and body-weight exercises such as push-ups and squats.
Include strength training exercises at least two to three times a week, focusing on all major muscle groups.
Start with less resistance and gradually increase as you build strength.
2. Mobility work: Maintaining muscle health is essential for preventing stiffness, supporting functional range of motion in your joints and reducing soft-tissue injury risk.
Aim to take your body through its full range of primary movements in all planes of motion during every workout.
Incorporating mobility-focused forms of exercise such as yoga and Pilates into your weekly routine can also help keep your muscles and joints healthy and mobile.
3. Balance exercises : “Falls are of big concern and the largest cause of morbidity as we age ,” Faubion said.
“This is why balance training is an important consideration.”
In addition to traditional single-leg balance training, exercises that rely on an unstable surface, such as a stability ball or even a paper plate sliding on the floor to create instability, can help improve your balance, core strength and coordination.
Integrating these exercises into your routine can significantly reduce the risk of falls and help you stay steady on your feet.
4. Cardiovascular fitness: Cardiovascular exercises are vital for maintaining heart health, improving circulation, increasing caloric burn and boosting overall endurance.
Lower-impact activities such as walking , swimming or indoor cycling are good choices for older adults.
In addition to the heart-health benefits, Faubion said: “Walking is a great weight-bearing exercise for building bone density as we age.” .
Women should put less emphasis on cardio and more on resistance-training exercises, according to Faubion.
“Of the 150 minutes of recommended weekly exercises, at least 20 minutes two times per week should be resistance training,” she said.
“For menopausal women this should be viewed as a minimum.”.
Before starting any new exercise program, be sure to consult with your health care provider to ensure it's safe and appropriate for your individual needs.
Consistency is key when it comes to reaping the benefits of exercise as you age.
That's why Faubion said she always tells her patients that “the best exercise is the one that you will actually do!”
She recommends focusing on what you like and are willing and wanting to do regularly.
Here are some other tips to help you create a safe, sustainable exercise routine:.
• Start slow: If you're new to exercise or returning after a break, start with low-intensity activities and gradually increase the intensity and duration as your fitness improves.
• Mix it u p: Incorporate a variety of exercises to keep your routine interesting and work different muscle groups.
Doing so can also help prevent overuse injuries.
• Listen to y our body: Pay attention to how your body feels during and after exercise.
If you experience pain or discomfort, modify the exercise or take a break.
• Stay consistent: Prioritize exercising regularly, even if it's just a short session.
Consistency over time is more important than length or intensity.
• Recover properly: Don't skip recovery .
Cool down after workouts, take adequate breaks between training sessions and get enough sleep .
• Consult a professional: Consider working with a personal trainer or physical therapist to create a tailored exercise plan that meets your needs and goals.
Aging is inevitable, but how you age is largely within your control.
By following the guidelines above, you can take charge of the aging process to preserve your health, independence and quality of life for years to come.

Title: The 'Muskification' of the federal government is in full swing | CNN Business
# The 'Muskification' of the federal government is in full swing | CNN Business.
New York CNN — .
In November 2022, days after Elon Musk took control of the company then called Twitter, employees received an email with the subject line: “A fork in the road.”
Now he's turned his attention to the US government, and federal workers just received a memo with the same subject line.
The Twitter email offered workers an ultimatum: commit to “exceptional performance” and working “extremely hardcore” or leave the company.
On Tuesday, the memo to federal government employees gave them a nearly identical choice: commit to “excellence,” and being “reliable, loyal, trustworthy,” among other things, or resign and take a buyout.
The strikingly similar language is perhaps the clearest sign yet that Musk — who is now a top advisor to President Donald Trump, with an office in the White House — appears to be bringing his Twitter takeover playbook to the federal government.
And it's raising questions about whether America's government could rapidly slash staff like a tech company, and whether it will suffer the same consequences as Twitter, including the broken systems and sharp decline in value that has bedeviled the social media company following his acquisition.
“The freeze in all federal spending feels eerily familiar to this former Twitter employee to when Elon took over,” Lara Cohen, who left her post after Musk's takeover as Twitter's global head of marketing and partners, said in a Threads post Tuesday.
“They come in, get no context, turn off everything without knowing who does what…
That was a social media company.
This is the country and this will hurt people beyond repair.” .
On the campaign trail, Musk talked frequently about downsizing the federal government.
And he played an integral part in the rollout of Tuesday's federal government buyouts , an official told CNN, through his position leading the Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ). .
And it makes sense why Trump would be on board with such a plan, said William Klepper, a professor of management at Columbia Business School.
“Trump is used to being in a reality show, right?
He's used to firing people.
That's a script that he has,” Klepper said.
But one environment is not necessarily like the other.
“Government is not business,” he said.
“In business, the winning formula is the one that results in providing greater value to customers than your competitors and gives you superior profitability.
In government, it's a different perspective, for the most part you (trying to) create greater value for your constituents in terms of what you're offering them in programming and services.”.
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt sidestepped a question Wednesday from CNN about Musk's involvement in the buyout, instead saying Musk's work at DOGE has been “incredibly productive.”.
On Wednesday, Musk claimed in an X post that, “Downsizing government is the most popular issue by far!”
The post referenced a Reuters/Ipsos poll that mainly shows opposition to Trump's executive orders but says that 44% of Americans support ending government “diversity, equity and inclusion” initiatives.
The day before Musk closed his $44 billion deal to buy Twitter, which he's re-dubbed X, he walked through the front door with a sink.
Starting within hours of his takeover the following day, Musk took something like a hacksaw to the company, moves that he said were essential to “save” the company but that caused chaos.
The billionaire laid off a majority of the company's staff — and then had to ask dozens of workers to return.
He ordered the closure of at least one data center — and the platform experienced numerous glitches and outages in the following months.
He slashed the company's safety teams, dismantled content moderation policies and welcomed White supremacists and misinformation peddlers back to the platform — and many users and advertisers fled .
The company was sued by landlords and vendors who accused it of failing to pay up for rent or agreed upon services.
And it was investigated by San Francisco city officials for putting up an illegal sign and over reports that Musk's team had set up bedrooms in office spaces.
Those and other controversial moves by the world's richest man — among them, using the site to boost racist conspiracy theories — have by most accounts turned what was once one of the world's most important and influential sources of real-time information into a more toxic, less reliable and less useful place and fueled the emergence of several competing platforms. (Still, Musk and the company's other leaders continue to refer to X as a global town square.) .
And since Musk's takeover, the company's value has fallen by about 80%, Fidelity estimated last fall.
Still, while the takeover may have hurt Twitter employees, users, advertisers and - at least in one sense — Musk's own pocketbook, it has also added to his own personal power.
Over the summer, Musk used X to try to sway public opinion in favor of Trump.
And since Trump's reelection, Musk now has the president's ear and an office in the White House — and he's become tens of billions of additional dollars richer , on the back of expectations that his connection to Trump will benefit his empire of companies.
And for that reason, he may have little incentive to change his employment - and layoff - strategy in his new role at DOGE.
-CNN's Samantha Waldenberg and Alayna Treene contributed to this report.
Correction: A previous version of this story misstated the bathroom appliance that Musk brought to Twitter headquarters the week of his takeover.
It was a sink. .

Title: DOJ sues to block Hewlett Packard Enterprise's $14 billion Juniper deal | CNN Business
# DOJ sues to block Hewlett Packard Enterprise's $14 billion Juniper deal | CNN Business.
Reuters — .
The US Department of Justice has sued to block Hewlett Packard Enterprise's $14 billion deal to acquire networking gear maker Juniper Networks, arguing that it would stifle competition, according to a complaint filed on Thursday.
Shares of both the server maker and Juniper Networks fell more than 3% in afternoon trading.
The antitrust lawsuit marks the first since President Donald Trump took office last week.
The DOJ argued that the acquisition would eliminate competition and would lead to only two companies — Cisco Systems and HPE — controlling more than 70% of the US market for networking equipment.
More than a year ago, the server maker said that it would buy Juniper Networks for $14 billion in an all-cash deal, as it looks to spruce up its artificial intelligence offerings.
The companies said in a joint statement that they would defend the deal, arguing that the acquisition will bring together two complementary networking offerings to better compete with global incumbent players.
“Juniper has also introduced innovative tools that have materially decreased the cost of operating a wireless network for many customers.
This competitive pressure has forced HPE to discount its offerings and invest in its own innovation,” the DOJ said in its complaint.
Juniper gained prominence over the past few years as data centers flocked to its products for use in AI applications.
Stiff competition from Juniper forced HPE to sell its products at a discount and spend to introduce new features under the “Beat Mist” campaign, named after the networking gear company's rival product, the DOJ wrote.
“Having failed to beat Mist on the merits, HPE changed tactics and in January 2024 opted to try to buy Juniper instead,” the agency added.
HPE representatives met with Trump's antitrust enforcers regarding its bid for Juniper, Bloomberg News reported earlier this week.
The UK Competition and Markets authority and the European Union have cleared the deal.

Title: Trump's tariffs could raise car prices at dealerships — very quickly | CNN Business
# Trump's tariffs could raise car prices at dealerships - very quickly | CNN Business.
New York CNN — .
The Trump administration is threatening a 25% tariff on all imports from Canada and Mexico as soon as Saturday — a move that would almost immediately impact car dealerships and factories in the United States.
The tariffs would add a minimum of thousands of dollars to the cost of cars, according to experts.
And not just cars that are assembled in those two countries and shipped to the United States, but also cars built at American auto plants, all of which have Canadian and Mexican parts that can not easily be replaced.
President Donald Trump had argued on the campaign trail that tariffs are the only way to save the American auto industry , even though automakers are reporting record , or near-record, profits without them.
But what is clear is that tariffs could upend the production of vehicles across the continent and put the price of cars, already near record highs , out of reach for many buyers.
Car factories could start slowing down — or even shutting down — in relatively short order, Michael Robinet, vice president of forecast strategy at S&P Global Mobility, told CNN last week.
That's because even if a car is assembled in the United States, every vehicle has parts imported from Mexico and Canada that would be subject to the tariffs, raising production costs.
There simply is no such thing as an all-American car .
Automakers in the three countries have operated as a relatively unified market for years , due to NAFTA and subsequently the USMCA trade deals, as vehicles and parts moved freely across the border, sometimes multiple times before a car is completed. .
Tariffs have a strong possibility of skewing and disrupting the car market in a way similar to during the Covid-19 pandemic, according to Robinet.
Limited supplies of new cars for sale following Covid sent new car prices, and even used car prices, soaring.
Robinet said automakers will do a cost calculation soon after the tariffs go into effect, and could decide that it is better to slow or even stop production at US plants rather than pay the tariffs imposed on their Canadian and Mexican parts.
They'll do so hoping that the trade dispute is worked out before the inventory of cars and trucks on their dealer lots is exhausted, he said.
Robinet believes slowdowns or shutdowns could come fairly quickly, especially at plants automakers operate in Mexico and Canada.
Mexico built about 4 million vehicles last year, while Canada built 1.3 million, according to data from S&P. And roughly 3.7 million, or about 70% of those Canadian- and Mexican-assembled vehicles, were shipped to showrooms in the United States.
By contrast, there were 10.2 million passenger vehicles built at US assembly plants in 2024.
And it's not just Fords and Chevrolets being churned out of American auto plants.
The Subaru Outback is built in Indiana, and thousands of BMW X5 SUVs roll out of a plant each week in South Carolina.
Mercedes SUVs are built in Alabama, and the popular Kia Telluride is built in Georgia.
Nearly half of the 10 million vehicles built at American auto plants are for those foreign brands.
But perhaps more importantly, those 10.2 million cars that are “made in America” are all built with Mexican and Canadian parts — from relatively cheap wire harnesses and fasteners to expensive engines and transmissions.
The impact will thus be felt in short order, Robinet added.
And cars and their parts aren't just flowing over the borders into the United States.
Plenty of them leave the United States, too, as American factories ship a fair number of their own vehicles and parts to Canada and Mexico.
Mexican and Canadian authorities have threatened to slap retaliatory tariffs on American goods if the Trump administration goes ahead with its tariff threat.
So some of the cars and parts built at US plants won't be able to get to their buyers north and south of the border without thousands of dollars worth of tariffs, as well.
## US ships cars, parts to Canada and Mexico too .
The United States shipped $13.8 billion worth of cars to Canada during the first 11 months of 2024 and $26.5 billion worth of parts.
It also shipped $4.2 billion worth of vehicles to Mexico in the same period and $33.7 billion worth of parts.
Others don't believe production at US plants will be affected immediately, but agree it won't continue for long if tariffs are imposed and aren't quickly resolved.
Some automakers have likely been stockpiling the parts they need from those two countries so they can keep tariff-free production going as long as possible.
Even if they have to pay some tariffs on parts in their American-built vehicles, the additional costs might not be crippling for some of the cheaper parts, Erin Keating, executive analyst at Cox Automotive, told CNN.
But she also doesn't think the industry will stomach tariffs for an extended period of time.
“I don't see the industry tolerating it for very long,” she said.
“Within maybe 30 to 45 days, I could see them moving onto Plan B and Plan C if this is not resolving itself.”.
She said plants in Mexico and Canada might continue to produce cars and just not ship them to the United States until the situation is resolved.
All the major automakers either had little comment about what they will do if tariffs go into effect or did not respond to CNN's request for comment.
“We aren't going to comment on speculation,” said Mark Giles, spokesman for Volkswagen, which not only has a plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, but also the largest car factory in Mexico.
And if production is scaled back, or if shipments from Canadian or Mexican plants are put on hold, dealers are not going to be eager to sell their current supply of vehicles at current market prices, in anticipation that a shortage could drive up prices in the weeks and months to come, said Robinet and Ivan Drury, director of insights at Edmunds.
“Right now, sales have been somewhat weak.
But if production does stop, it will not take many days for the dealers to be much more firm on pricing,” Drury told CNN.
The average days' supply of vehicles now available at US dealerships range from 25 days for Toyota Motor, which includes Lexus, to 73 days supply for Ford Motor, which includes its Lincoln luxury brand.
It will be important for the dealers and the automakers to have this issue resolved by March or April, said Keating.
That's when tax refunds start to arrive and makes the spring a key sales period for automakers.
“If we look out 45 days, we're into prime tax refund season.
I think you'd hear tremendous amount from dealers if there's a shortage of vehicles then,” said Keating.
But once the tariffs are in place, it's going to be the car buyers — not the automakers, the dealers, or Mexico or Canada — who will be paying the thousands of dollars more for each vehicle, said Robinet.
“American car buyers, Canadian car buyers, Mexican car buyers — that's who's paying the tariffs,” he said.
“Automakers and parts suppliers are not charities.
They're not going to absorb the cost.”.

Title: Analysis: Trump wants an 'Iron Dome' over the US.
But even a mini version in the Pacific is taking a while | CNN
# Analysis: Trump wants an 'Iron Dome' over the US.
But even a mini version in the Pacific is taking a while | CNN.
Seoul, South Korea CNN — .
President Donald Trump has called for an expansive, next-generation missile defense shield for the mainland United States, something modeled on Israel's formidable defenses, typified by its signature Iron Dome system.
A defensive dome for the US - a country hundreds of times the size of Israel - would require massive scale, as well as space-based interceptors, and almost certainly be decades away.
Yet on the piece of US soil perhaps most vulnerable to missile attacks - the Pacific island of Guam - work is well underway on the kind of multi-layered missile defense that could point the way.
However, experts say even that faces steep challenges.
“There are no fast or panacea solutions, and we are making the decisions late in the game even though visionary military and political leaders saw this coming in the 1990s,” said Carl Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command's Joint Intelligence Center.
The US territory of Guam, a 210-square-mile island in the Pacific Ocean, is home to just under 175,000 people.
It also hosts Andersen Air Force Base - a key deployment base for US Air Force bombers such as the B-1 and B-52 and sometimes the stealthy B-2 - and is homeport to US nuclear attack submarines that could be vital in any defense of Taiwan.
The island is less than 1,900 miles (3,000 kilometers) from China (PRC) and 2,100 miles from North Korea.
Mockups of it have shown up in China's military propaganda videos , and North Korea has made threats against it.
But the US military has not stood still, advancing its ability to defend against regional threats.
Just last December, the US Missile Defense Agency (MDA) conducted the first successful intercept of a ballistic missile target from the island using the Aegis Guam System, which fired a land-based interceptor of the type that US Navy ships have used to destroy ballistic missile targets in testing.
“Current forces are capable of defending Guam against today's North Korean ballistic missile threats.
However, the regional threat to Guam, including those from PRC, continues to rapidly evolve,” the MDA's director for operations, Michelle Atkinson, said in 2023.
In the December test, a US Air Force C-17 plane released a medium-range ballistic missile target off Guam's coast.
After the target was tracked by powerful radar, an interceptor was fired from a Vertical Launch System on the island, taking it out outside Earth's atmosphere, according to releases by MDA and Lockheed Martin, the manufacturer of the Aegis system on Guam.
It was a “a critical milestone in the defense of Guam and the region,” said US Navy Rear Adm.
Greg Huffman, commander, Joint Task Force-Micronesia.
But the intercept test went beyond the land-based Aegis system, with other military elements testing systems that would form key parts of the multi-layered concept Trump would like to see.
That's something akin to what Israel fields, a four-tiered system often lumped under the “Iron Dome” moniker, after its best-known and lowest layer.
While the Iron Dome combats incoming rockets and artillery weapons, David's Sling protects against short- and medium-range threats, and the Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 systems stop ballistic missiles.
In a nod to a similarly layered defensive structure, US Indo-Pacific Command said it used December's intercept to test tracking capabilities of the US Army's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system based on Guam.
THAAD is designed to stop incoming missiles in their terminal, or descent, phase of flight, while Aegis makes its intercept in the mid-course phase, outside Earth's atmosphere, before the missiles dive on their target.
The US military also employs Patriot missile batteries, designed to make much lower-altitude intercepts, as the final phase of Guam's defense.
Both the THAAD and Patriot systems have been successfully used in combat.
All three - Aegis, THAAD and Patriot - will eventually form what is called the Enhanced Integrated Air and Missile Defense System (EIAMD) on Guam, which the MDA says will provide “360-degree coverage, and layered defense against regional ballistic, maneuvering ballistic, hypersonic glide, and cruise missile threats.”.
That system would also rely on input from US satellites and space-based sensors, according to the MDA, inching it closer to Trump's missile defense vision.
But the timeline for full Guam missile defense - expected to take at least a decade to put together - is indicative of the challenges in constructing any system to fight ballistic and hypersonic glide missiles.
That's not helped by constant technological advances in missile technology, which often evolves more quickly than ways to defend against it.
And Trump's concept of a next-generation missile defense for the continental US goes well beyond what is still years away on Guam, an island about 10 times the size of Manhattan.
In his executive order, Trump said he would “direct (the US) military to begin construction of the great Iron Dome missile defense shield, which will be made all in the USA,” as the US faces a “catastrophic threat” from ballistic, cruise and hypersonic missiles. .
His ambitious executive order called for an acceleration in “the development and deployment of Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor Layers, proliferated space-based interceptors, a Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture, capabilities to defeat salvoes prior to launch, non-kinetic missile defense capabilities, and underlayer and terminal-phase intercept capabilities.”.
Trump's order does not give any estimate of the costs of such a system, but several hundreds of billions of dollars would probably be a conservative estimate.
“The costs of reliably defending an area the size of the United States against a wide variety of threats at multiple different intercept points would be astronomical,” said Matt Korda, associate director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists.
And as far as money goes, the advantage goes to the attacker.
“Offense is cheaper than defense every single time,” Korda said.
Even if US technology can develop and deploy all that Trump is asking for, impregnable missile defense could still prove impossible.
Though it is touted by many as the world's best missile defense, attacks by Iran last year showed that the Iron Done is far from unbeatable, with projectiles fired by Tehran and Houthi rebels landing in Israel.
Iran achieved that by firing large numbers of weapons at Israel.
While many of the around 180 missiles launched were intercepted, some got through.
Missile defense experts have long pointed out that's one way to beat any missile defense system.
Schuster, a former US Navy captain who worked on the Aegis missile defense system in its early days, said missile defenses can be “saturated,” pointing out that the incoming ballistic missile knows where it's going, but the interceptors have to be directed to their target.
“You can only guide so many (interceptors) at any one time while the ballistic missile has an internal guidance system,” Schuster said.
The problem for defenders becomes more difficult once warheads with “maneuverable reentry vehicles” - which can change directions after they reenter the atmosphere and approach targets from different directions - are added.
Both China and Russia have such capabilities.
“A target coming directly at you is the easiest to intercept.
The greater the lateral displacement from that, the more challenging the intercept equation,” Schuster said.
Adversaries can compound that problem by firing decoy missiles, which distract from more important targets - which if they involve nuclear warheads, could do catastrophic damage.
Of course, all that comes into play once a system is actually deployed.
And, according to Schuster, the biggest stumbling block for Trump's shield plan could be a US production and procurement system that has been neglected - despite the early successes demonstrated on Guam.
“Our production rates are criminally low in my opinion,” he said.
“We have been asleep at the switch … for over a decade.”.
And it's not just a manufacturing infrastructure problem, it's also the limited knowledge and skills to produce them, Schuster said.
“We are going to have to invest in both plant, which we do well, and people, which we don't do well.”.

Title: USAID: Elon Musk said Donald Trump agreed agency needs to be 'shut down' | CNN Politics
# USAID: Elon Musk said Donald Trump agreed agency needs to be 'shut down' | CNN Politics.
CNN — .
Elon Musk said President Donald Trump agreed the US Agency for International Development needs to be “shut down,” following days of speculation over the future of the agency after its funding was frozen and dozens of its employees were put on leave.
“With regards to the USAID stuff, I went over it with (the president) in detail and he agreed that we should shut it down,” Musk said in a X Spaces conversation early Monday.
Musk said he checked with Trump “a few times” and Trump confirmed he wants to shut down the agency, which dispenses billions in humanitarian aid and development funding annually.
CNN has reached out to the White House and USAID for comment.
Sunday evening, before the X Spaces conversation, when asked for comment on USAID, Trump told reporters: “It's been run by a bunch of radical lunatics, and we're getting them out, and then we'll make a decision” on its future.
Musk's comments come after two top security officials at USAID were put on administrative leave Saturday night for refusing members of the Department of Government Efficiency access to systems at the agency, even when DOGE personnel threatened to call law enforcement, multiple sources familiar with the situation told CNN.
Around 60 senior USAID staff were put on leave last week on accusations of attempting to circumvent Trump's executive order to freeze foreign aid for 90 days.
Another senior official was put on leave for trying to reverse that move after finding no evidence of wrongdoing.
In the X Spaces conversation early Monday, which he co-hosted with Republican Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa and Vivek Ramaswamy - who was initially named co-chair of DOGE with Musk but has since left - the X owner called USAID “incredibly politically partisan” and said it has been supporting “radically left causes throughout the world including things that are anti-American.”.
Musk said USAID is “beyond repair,” among other attacks he made against the agency created by Congress as an independent body.
We don't have “an apple with a worm in it,” he said.
“We have a ball of worms.”.
“USAID is a ball of worms.”.
USAID was established in 1961 under President John F. Kennedy's administration and is the US government's humanitarian arm.
It dispenses billions of dollars annually across the world in an effort to alleviate poverty, treat diseases, and respond to famines and natural disasters.
It also promotes democracy building and development by supporting non-government organizations, independent media and social initiatives.
USAID is a key soft power tool of the US to foster relations with communities around the world, officials say, noting that US national security is approached with the “three D” pillars: defense, diplomacy and development, led, respectively, by the Defense Department, State Department and USAID.
According to sources, personnel from the Musk-created office first physically tried to access the USAID headquarters in Washington, DC, and were stopped.
The DOGE personnel demanded to be let in and threatened to call US Marshals to be allowed access, two of the sources said.
The DOGE personnel wanted to gain access to USAID security systems and personnel files, three sources said.
Two of those sources also said the DOGE personnel wanted access to classified information, which only those with security clearances and a specific need to know are able to access.
Three sources told CNN that in the end, the DOGE personnel were eventually able to access the headquarters.
The incident, which had not been previously reported, is the latest showdown as the Trump-affiliated DOGE seeks to exert increasing authority over the federal government as it aims to slash spending.
In a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio Sunday, Democratic members of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee requested “an immediate update about the access of USAID's headquarters, including whether the individuals who accessed the headquarters were authorized to be there and by whom.”.
“The potential access of sensitive, even classified, files, which may include the personally identifiable information (PII) of Americans working with USAID, and this incident as a whole, raises deep concerns about the protection and safeguarding of matters related to U.S. national security,” the letter said.
The Senators also wrote that “any effort to merge or fold USAID into the Department of State should be, and by law must be, previewed, discussed and approved by Congress.
Katie Miller, whom Trump named to DOGE in December, on Sunday appeared to confirm that DOGE personnel had accessed classified information.
“No classified material was accessed without proper security clearances,” she posted on X.
On Sunday, in response to CNN's report about the incident, Musk said that “USAID is a criminal organization.”.
“Time for it to die,” he posted on X. .
Other top Trump officials, such as Stephen Miller, who serves as deputy chief of staff for policy at the White House, have also taken aim at USAID, accusing its workforce of being overwhelmingly Democrats.
On Saturday, USAID's website went dark and a new page for the agency appeared on the State Department website.
USAID's X account also went offline Saturday.
A source told CNN that the entire USAID public affairs office was put on leave and locked out of their systems.
Shortly after being sworn in last month, Trump issued a sweeping executive order pausing all foreign aid for 90 days, leading to widespread confusion , layoffs and program shutdowns.
USAID Director of Security John Voorhees and his deputy are among dozens of USAID officials who have been put on leave amid fears that the agency is being intentionally dismantled — a move that some aid officials argue would have massive negative implications.
Aid officials argue the State Department isn't equipped to take over and sustain USAID's vast number of development projects.
It would also erase, they argue, unique and essential soft power that can't be replicated.
The State Department doesn't “have the capacity, the expertise, the training to do that kind of work.
It is a completely separate line of effort that is undertaken on the ground,” a former senior USAID official said.
“The one element of the US government bureaucracy on the ground in foreign places that has been able to get out beyond the wire and actually have a deeper understanding of the places in which we work is USAID,” the former official continued, requesting anonymity due to growing and widespread fears of being targeted by the Trump administration.
“That ability to work in that way, that culture — and it is a culture I think — gets lost.
And with it, I think we lose an enormous, incredibly valuable tool of US foreign policy.
We're basically going to be punching with one arm behind our back,” the person said.

Title: US airlines' 16-year safety record ended with tragedy.
There were warnings ahead of the crash | CNN Business
# US airlines' 16-year safety record ended with tragedy.
There were warnings ahead of the crash | CNN Business.
New York CNN — .
US airlines had gone 16 years without a fatal crash until Wednesday night.
But as impressive as that safety record had been, there have been warning signs in recent years of a significant risk of a collision like the one that just killed 67 people.
A regional jet from Wichita, Kansas, operated as an American Airlines flight by feeder carrier PSA Airlines, was preparing to land at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport when it collided with a US Army Black Hawk helicopter that was crossing its path just a few hundred feet above the ground.
The cause of the crash was unknown Thursday as the investigation is just beginning.
It was the first fatal crash of a commercial US airplane since 2009.
As safe as air travel has become, the US air travel system has been under increasing stress in recent years — with a well-established shortage of the air traffic controllers throughout the nation, despite years of attempting to ramp up hiring.
And congestion in many major metropolitan areas, especially around Washington DC, make flying riskier than 16 crash-free years might suggest.
“I'm saddened, but I'm not surprised,” said Anthony Brickhouse, an aviation safety expert.
“In the last two to three years, we've had so many close calls with commercial planes having near collisions in and near airport environments.
If changes aren't made, you eventually meet with tragedy.”.
Experts say that while America retains a gold standard for airline safety and that commercial air travel is the safest form of travel, there are stresses on the system that have been apparent in a series of near tragedies in recent years.
A strained air traffic control system and congestion in the air space over many major cities has squeezed the margins of safety needed to operate the America's air transportation system, Captain Dennis Tajer, an American Airlines pilot, told CNN early Thursday.
“You've got all the things stacked up against you,” he said.
“We've got to protect the American public's trust in the system and prevent tragedies like this from ever happening again.
The saying goes, 'You have to investigate accidents before they happen, not after, to get long-term fixes.'
Complacency has no place in our skies today, and we have to make sure we maintain that attitude.”.
The near collisions, often wrongly referred to by the public as “near misses,” are far more common that most passengers know.
In fact just one day before the crash, another regional jet approaching Reagan National airport was forced to abort its first landing and go around after a helicopter flew near its flight path, according to air traffic control audio.
That regional jet, inbound from Bradley International Airport near Hartford, Connecticut, began a climbing right, and told air traffic control, “We had … helicopter traffic below us.”
It soon landed safely at the airport.
The incident was first reported by the Washington Post .
Thursday CNN found at least two other pilots in the last three years reported near-collisions with helicopters while landing at Reagan National, according to federal incident reports.
The two passenger planes had to take evasive action to avoid colliding with a helicopter when trying to land at the airport, according to reports filed by pilots.
In a third incident, two military helicopters got too close together, an air traffic controller reported.
“It's unbelievable how much we fly without incident,” said former FAA Administrator Randy Babbitt told CNN.
“So when we do have one, it lights up everything.”.
There have many been other such incidents that are characterized as near collisions by the FAA.
One occurred less than three weeks ago in Phoenix when a United Airlines flight from San Francisco carrying 123 passengers and six crew members and a Delta Air Lines flight carrying 245 passengers from Detroit both got clearance to land at virtually the same time, resulting in both receiving warnings they were too close to one another.
The aircraft were 1,217 feet — less than a quarter-mile — apart, according to data from flight-tracking site Flightradar24 .
The cockpit warning systems that alerted those two planes likely was not able to warn the pilots in the American Airlines flight Wednesday night, because it was only 375 feet above the ground when the Army helicopter was approaching it.
Details of what warning the pilots of both aircraft received will be determined in the upcoming crash investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board.
Some near collisions take place on the ground, not in the air.
But they can be just as dangerous, given the speed that planes are traveling on takeoff or landing.
On December 27, a charter jet carrying the Gonzaga men's basketball team nearly crossed a runway at Los Angeles International Airport on which a Delta plane was taking off.
Some of the near collisions brought two planes even closer to one another.
On February 4, 2023, a FedEx jet came within 150 feet of the runway before its pilots realized a Southwest jet was taking off on the same runway.
It was one of five such incidents in a period of just seven weeks at the start of last year.
And none of those were potentially as serious as an incident in July 2017, when an Air Canada jet piloted by a captain who had been awake for more than 19 hours nearly landed on a taxiway at San Francisco International Airport where three wide-body jets filled with passengers were waiting to take off.
The NTSB later determined the Air Canada jet got within 100 feet of the ground before it took off again without making contact with any of the passenger planes on the ground.
The safety regulator said more than 1,000 people on the four planes might have died had the accident not been averted at the last moment.
“It would have been the worst disaster in aviation history,” Brickhouse, the aviation safety expert, said.
“Pilots, air traffic controllers, mechanics — they're all human, and humans make mistakes.
We've been working toward designing the system so that when mistakes are made, we can recover from them without it being a tragedy.” .
And such near collisions have become so common that the Federal Aviation Administration announced an audit of such incidents last fall.
Additionally, there was just one air traffic controller working two different tower positions at the time of the collision Wednesday night, an air traffic control source tells CNN.
The source described the set-up, which had one person handling both local and helicopter traffic, as not uncommon.
The Reagan National control tower is 85% staffed, the source said, with 24 of 28 positions filled.

Despite the fact that there is nothing known at this point as to the who was at fault for the crash — air traffic control, the plane's pilot or the helicopter's pilot, let alone the qualifications of the people involved in those roles Wednesday night — President Donald Trump, without evidence, blamed the crash on Democrats' efforts to have a “ diversity push ” as part of the hiring process at the the FAA's air traffic control system.
Vice President JD Vance echoed that claim.
Asked at a press conference if he was blaming the air traffic controllers for the crash, or had evidence that they were in that job despite not being qualified, Trump responded , “It just could have been.”
Asked why he believed diversity hiring efforts played a role in the crash, he responded, “Because I have common sense, OK, and unfortunately, a lot of people don't.” .
Trump has signed executive orders banning diversity, equity and inclusion programs at most of the federal government, including the Transportation Department.
But he had not nominated a new head of the FAA until Thursday's press conference, when he announced that he had picked Chris Rocheleau to lead the nation's key aviation safety regulator.
The previous FAA administrator, Michael Whitaker, left the job the day Trump took office.
Some airports and air space are under more stress than others.
Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport has the busiest runway in the nation.
The airport has seen a number of near collisions in recent years, including an American Airlines flight bound for Boston in May that was forced to abort takeoff to avoid another plane that was landing.
And a JetBlue plane and Southwest plane nearly collided on the runway of Reagan National Airport in Washington on April 18, when one was cleared for takeoff as the other was directed to cross the runway it was on.
Tight restrictions on where planes can fly is a major issue in Washington DC, with narrow flight paths to avoid areas with high-security needs like the Capitol building and White House.
The nation's capital represents a unique conundrum for flights in the US.
Demand is huge at Reagan Washington National thanks to how close it is to downtown Washington.
And members of Congress, which controls how many aircraft can use that airport, are often pushing for more direct flights to more destinations.
Congress approved five additional round trip flights at the airport just last fall.
At a press conference at the airport early Thursday, just hours after the crash, Senator Jerry Moran said that he had pushed American to schedule the flight from Wichita to the Washington airport.
“I know that flight.
I've flown it many times myself,” said Moran, a Republican from Kansas. “
I lobbied American Airlines to begin having a direct nonstop flight service to DCA.
That flight has been existence about a year.”.
At press conferences Thursday morning, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who took office just hours before the crash, said he is convinced that the air traffic system is safe but that the crash is a sign that things need to change.
“What happened yesterday should not have happened,” he said.
“When Americans take off in airplanes, they should expect to land at their destination.
That didn't happen yesterday.
That's not acceptable.”.

Title: Elon Musk bashes the $500 billion AI project Trump announced, claiming its backers don't 'have the money' | CNN Business
# Elon Musk bashes the $500 billion AI project Trump announced, claiming its backers don't 'have the money' | CNN Business.
CNN — .
Shortly after President Donald Trump announced a new massive AI infrastructure investment from the White House, “First Buddy” Elon Musk tried to tear it down.
“They don't actually have the money,” Musk wrote on his social media platform X. “SoftBank has well under $10B secured.
I have that on good authority.”.
Trump said the investment will create a new company, called Stargate, to grow artificial intelligence infrastructure in the United States.
The leaders of SoftBank, OpenAI and Oracle stood alongside Trump during the announcement.
Their respective companies will invest $100 billion in total for the project to start, with plans to pour up to $500 billion into Stargate in the coming years.
The comments are a notable takedown of a major White House project from someone that is in Trump's innermost circle.
As a sign of how involved Musk is in the first days of the administration, Musk said he was in the Oval Office on Tuesday as Trump signed a pardon for Ross William Ulbricht, founder of the dark web marketplace SilkRoad.
Musk had also dispatched a top staffer from his SpaceX and X companies to help ensure the release of convicted January 6 rioters after Trump signed a blanket pardon.
But perhaps it should not be a surprise that Musk is going after an OpenAI initiative.
Musk is in an ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman, who was at the White House for the announcement.
Musk, who has said he “doesn't trust” Altman, claims in the lawsuit the ChatGPT has abandoned its original nonprofit mission by reserving some of its most advanced AI technology for private customers.
The companies involved in Stargate have not publicly disclosed how they will contribute the funds, but they don't necessarily need the money in the bank to support it — they could raise debt or sign on other equity investors.
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Wednesday rebuffed Musk's comments, saying in a Fox News interview, “the American people should take President Trump and those CEOs' words for it.”.
“President Trump is very excited about this infrastructure announcement in the field of AI, which is obviously growing, and something the United States of America needs to capitalize on, because our adversaries, such as China, are very advanced in this field,” Leavitt said.
“So, the American people should take President Trump and those CEOs' words for it -- these investments are coming to our great country, and American jobs are coming along with them.”.
Altman replied directly to Musk's claim on X, writing “wrong, as you surely know. want to come visit the first site already under way? this is great for the country. i realize what is great for the country isn't always what's optimal for your companies, but in your new role i hope you'll mostly put (America) first.”.
A source familiar with Stargate said Musk's assertion is not true.
Softbank, the source pointed out, has $24.3 billion of cash on its balance sheet per its latest earnings and that it is comfortable taking on more debt to help fund the project, the wherewithal to access more capital.
The source pointed out that MGX has $100 billion in capital commitments, Oracle has $11 billion in cash on its balance sheet and OpenAI recently announced it has more than $10 billion from its recent round of venture capital.
Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, which is working with OpenAI on Stargate, said on CNBC Wednesday “all I know is I'm good for my $80 billion.”.

Title: Groundhog Day: Punxsutawney Phil sees his shadow, predicts six more weeks of winter | CNN
# Groundhog Day: Punxsutawney Phil sees his shadow, predicts six more weeks of winter | CNN.
CNN — .
Punxsutawney Phil, the famous groundhog weather watcher , was pulled from his warm burrow this morning and saw his shadow, predicting six more weeks of winter.
Each February 2, on Groundhog Day , the members of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club make the pilgrimage to Gobbler's Knob — Phil's official home.
Legend has it, if he sees his shadow , six more weeks of winter are on the way.
If he doesn't, an early spring arrives.
In reality, winter will end on the spring equinox, known also as the vernal equinox, on March 20 at 5:01 a.m. ET, regardless of Sunday's prediction.
But weather conditions don't always follow the timetable — and neither does Phil.
Phil has been prognosticating since the late 1800s but his recent predictions would have a better track record if he just flipped a coin: He has only been right about 35% of the time since 2005, according to data analyzed by NOAA.
Phil's call for an early spring last year came true.
February 2024 was the third warmest on record for the Lower 48.
March also ended up much warmer than normal, according to NOAA data.
There are more consistent experts to turn to when Phil falters.
Meteorologists at the National Weather Service's Climate Prediction Center produce forecasts for temperatures and precipitation across the US on timescales ranging from one week to more than a year.
Their outlook for February calls for above-average temperatures, or a potential early spring, from parts of the Rockies through the South and much of the East.
Below-average temperatures from the Pacific Northwest into parts of the Midwest could be an extended winter.
These regional trends are likely to continue into early spring, the center's forecasts through April show.
Rounds of brutal cold have pounded the eastern half of the US all winter.
It was the coldest Presidential Inauguration in 40 years and cold unusually far south ushered in a historic snowstorm for the Gulf Coast .
It's been one of the 10-coldest winters for dozens of cities east of the Mississippi River, according to the Southeast Regional Climate Center .
But the West has remained warm this winter following the warmest fall on record for the Lower 48 .
Phoenix, Las Vegas and San Francisco are just a few cities experiencing one of their 10-warmest winters.
Warmer winters aren't a fluke, even when punctuated with seasonably appropriate cold.
Winter has become the fastest-warming season for nearly 75% of the US as temperatures rise globally in a world warming due to fossil fuel pollution.
So, Phil's prediction of six more weeks of winter is a bad bet in a warming world.

CNN — .
Megan Rathmell thought she'd bombed her job interview earlier this year, assuming her nervousness and lack of preparation had cost her the opportunity. .
The 20-year-old later found out she got the job as a paralegal — and what made her stand out was her ability to do two important things: maintain eye contact and carry on a conversation. .
“My boss told me that I was a good communicator and that I was able to make strong eye contact, and that he hasn't seen this from a lot of my peers,” said Rathmell, who is based in Virginia.
“That was really surprising to me.”.
What Rathmell learned from her boss mirrors what hiring managers say: Some Gen Z college graduates are unprepared for job interviews or behave unprofessionally during job interviews.
They bring parents to in-person interviews, refuse to turn the camera on during virtual interviews, use inappropriate language, dress unprofessionally and struggle to make eye contact.
While there have always been people who interviewed badly for jobs, “it does seem to be more prevalent today,” said Dr. Nathan Mondragon, chief innovation officer at the hiring platform HireVue.
There could be several factors contributing to the problem.
The digital age has made many people less experienced with in-person interactions and therefore less comfortable with them especially challenging ones.
Pandemic safety precautions only made that worse, Mondragon said.
And while some parents are overinvolved in their child's professional pursuits, others aren't teaching them how to navigate the professional world without parental handholding.
Some people think they can just wing a job interview, said Stacie Haller, chief career advisor at ResumeBuilder.
But just like anything else you want to be successful at, getting a job also requires preparation.
There will be plenty of competition for those jobs, as new employment data released by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday shows.
The number of employed people increased by 254,000 in September, and the unemployment rate dropped to 4.1% from 4.2%, according to BLS data on nonfarm payroll employment. (That excludes people working as farmers, nonprofit or private household employees, and more.).
There are about 6.8 million people who currently want a job — so here's what you should do before, during and after an interview to stand out and get the job you want.
Before you get an interview, you need to stand out from hundreds of other applicants, and you have about six seconds to catch a recruiter's eye using your resume , Haller said.
Therefore, your resume should be one compelling, clear and uncrowded page that is tailored to the position and highlights why you're the best candidate.
Be careful who you get advice from, Haller said.
If you know other people who work at the company or in similar industries, consulting them could be good.
Parents and other people their age, however, likely have good intentions but may have not interviewed for a job in decades or ever worked in your industry, and the workforce is different now.
Unless you've gone to a specialty school, your college or graduate school career center may not have employees with any experience in hiring people, so it's not always helpful, Haller said.
Look the career center employees up online to see if they have a relevant track record.
Do your research.
One of the biggest mistakes some interviewees make is asking questions about things they could have easily found by looking at just the homepage of a company's website, said Dr. Nicolas Roulin, professor of industrial/organizational psychology at Saint Mary's University in Canada.
That, as well as not asking any questions at all, tells the interviewer you haven't done your homework and probably don't care about the job. .
Thoroughly research the company, experts said.
You must be able to answer the question, “Why do you want to work here?” and express how you can contribute to the company's values, culture, strategies, goals and more.
By researching the interviewers, as well — if you have their names — you can ask them more in-depth questions about their job, goals and lives, and you may even find you have a fun personal connection to bring up, such as having attended the same school.
Websites such as LinkedIn or Glassdoor can help you find some of this information.
Glassdoor reviews are typically left by current or former employees.
Write down your answers in advance.
During the interview, you'll also need to demonstrate how well you fit, and can perform, the job description.
You can prepare by writing down your success stories for each requirement within that description, using the STAR technique .
That acronym stands for situation, task, action and result — define the situation, what task needed to be accomplished, what actions you took alone or as part of a team to do so, and what the results were.
Prepare your questions.
Your questions are just as important as your answers, and they should show interest, motivation and care, as well as what's important to you, experts said.
Here are some examples, which you can practice on your own or in mock interviews with friends or family:.
* What does a day on the job look like?
What about the first few weeks? .
* Is this a new role, or did someone leave it? .
* How would you measure the success of an employee in three months and in six months? .
* What are the benefits and challenges of working here? .
* What kind of training opportunities are there? .
* What is the opportunity for promotion after a year? .
* What are your own short- and long-term goals here? .
If you struggle with nervousness before interviews, relaxation or breathing techniques can help , Roulin said.
Experiencing more severe anxiety may require therapy .
### How to handle the actual job interview .
Dressing professionally for both in-person and virtual interviews is important regardless of whether it's for a fast-food restaurant, retail store or office job, experts said.
Business casual is usually best — no jeans, shorts, flip-flops or overly revealing clothing.
If the company culture is more casual, that doesn't automatically mean you should dress like them for your interview, Haller said.
Those employees have already had the chance to show over time that they do great work despite how they're dressed, but they don't know you yet.
You need to make a good impression that shows you're respectful and serious.
At the same time, don't go overboard by wearing a three-piece suit and appearing totally out of touch, Haller said — unless that's the dress code.
Bring all those notes you prepared to the interview, but don't bring your parents.
That can imply immaturity and incapability, and you're the one who needs to be able to do the job without them.
Where you do the interview is also important.
The setting should be as distraction- and noise-free as possible, so avoid conducting it from a public space, such as a coffeeshop.
Turning your camera off is generally inappropriate, experts said, and it can suggest you're hiding something or uncomfortable dealing with people — which is obviously a concerning red flag since most jobs require dealing with people.

If you don't have an answer for a question, ask the interviewer to rephrase or say “I don't have much experience with that particular issue, but I can tell you about a time when X.” You can also say you would like an opportunity to really think about the question if they would let you get back to them with an answer.
These alternatives show you're adaptable, and they allow you to show off in other ways.
When you're given the chance to ask questions, ask what you've prepared.
But save questions about salary, availability expectations and vacation benefits for a point towards the end of the interview, Mondragon said.
These questions are important for your survival and quality of life, something Gen Z cares more about than previous generations — which is a great thing, he added.
Some states, such as Colorado and New York, have even required that job postings state the salary.
But you don't want to appear to care more about not working than working. .
How you ask also matters.
“Can you tell me about the company's benefits packages for employees at this level?” sounds better than “How many days off do I get?” .
At the end, ask if there's anything else you could provide to show you're a great candidate for the position, Haller said.
“You want to overcome any objections.
And then you always want to ask about the next steps and express your interest.”.
Within 24 hours after the interview, email a thank you note expressing gratitude for the interviewer's time and the opportunity, Haller said.
But know that your message is more than a thank you note — it's also an indirect reminder to hire you.
If you get a call for another interview or a job offer, respond as immediately as possible, experts said.
Even if you're no longer interested, you should still quickly communicate that, too — it's the respectful thing to do, and you don't want to burn any bridges you may need to cross again in the future. .
Do not follow up with an employer about whether there's any news before the time they said they'll be in touch, Roulin said.
After that is when you can check in once a week.

Title: DeepSeek just blew up the AI industry's narrative that it needs more money and power | CNN Business
# DeepSeek just blew up the AI industry's narrative that it needs more money and power | CNN Business.
A version of this story appeared in CNN Business' Nightcap newsletter.

New York CNN — .
The story of AI in the 2020s has gone something like this:.
* Sam Altman: Look, a toy that can write your book report.
* VCs: This will fix everything! .
* Doomers: This will ruin everything.
* Tech: We need money! .
* Everyone else: Could we maybe not destroy the environment over this? .
* Tech: Let's restart Three Mile Island.
* Tech: We need money! .
* Wall Street: Where's our return ? .
* Tech: ( Chants ) More power!
More power!
More power! .
And finally, in the year 2025, here comes DeepSeek to blow up the industry's whole narrative about AI's bottomless appetite for power, and potentially break the spell that had kept Wall Street funneling money to anyone with the words “harnessing artificial intelligence” in their pitch deck.
ICYMI: DeepSeek dropped a bomb known as R1 that's got all of Silicon Valley and much of Wall Street in a tizzy.
The Chinese company's large language model is basically a cheaper , more efficient ChatGPT, built on a fraction of OpenAI's budget and using far fewer chips than any other leading chatbot.
“That is a massive earthquake in the AI sector,” Gil Luria, head of tech research at investment group D.A. Davidson, told me.
“Everybody is looking at it and saying, 'We didn't think this is possible.
And since it is possible, we have to rethink everything that we have been planning.
'”.
Suddenly, all that money and computing power that the Sam Altmans , Mark Zuckerbergs and Elon Musks have been saying are crucial to their AI projects — and thus America's continued leadership in the industry — may end up being wildly overblown.
DeepSeek, which on Monday climbed to No. 1 on the Apple app store, claims to have built its base model for less than $6 million (versus the more than $100 million Altman has said it cost to build GPT-4)..
It also claims to have used just 2,000 Nvidia chips that it obtained before US export restrictions were put in place. (OpenAI says it used 25,000 of the more powerful Nvidia H100 chips to build GPT-4.).
It's awkward timing for the Trump administration, which last week announced a half-trillion-dollar private-sector investment to build more data centers and keep the United States ahead of China in the AI race. ( Oops! ) .
And it's incredibly bad news for Nvidia, the American chip maker powering the AI gold rush.
Nvidia shares sank 17% Monday, shedding $600 billion in market cap in a single session — the biggest one-day loss for a single stock in history.
Alphabet, Microsoft, Oracle, TSMC and plenty of others sank, and because tech stocks are so dominant, that dragged the broader stock market down, too.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged by 3% and the broader S&P 500 fell 1.5%. (The Dow, buoyed by health care and consumer companies, ended the day up less than 1%.).
Of course, one bad day on Wall Street does not an apocalypse make. (That's for later, when one of these AI labs creates superintelligent murder bots.
Kidding!
Kind of.) .
But DeepSeek is forcing investors to take a beat and question tech companies' assumptions.
By its own reasoning, the AI industry needed to keep increasing “compute” (or computational power), which meant buying tens of thousands of Nvidia's state-of-the-art chips and building giant data centers.
“DeepSeek makes it very clear that that the current trajectory of scaling up of data centers is highly unlikely to be economic to Nvidia's customers,” Luria said.
The AI industry, and OpenAI in particular, has been going down two paths at once.
There's the business of designing AI models with better algorithms and sounder reasoning — the kind of stuff that requires “finesse, as opposed to brute force,” Luria says.
And then there's the Stargate path of giant energy investments.
The first task is still “valid and important,” while the second path looks “ridiculous,” Luria said.
“DeepSeek makes it clear that that scale and that spend would be, at the very least, wasteful.”.
In other words, AI isn't dead.
But the landscape is shifting faster than anyone, perhaps most of all Nvidia, expected.
## Picks and shovels .
Nvidia has become the ultimate “picks and shovels” play on Wall Street, transforming it into a $3 trillion company in the span of a couple of years.
Up until now, the demand for Nvidia chips appeared boundless — tech companies were going to keep gobbling them up faster than Nvidia could produce them.
But if DeepSeek really did manage to build a ChatGPT competitor using a handful of old processors, then maybe Nvidia's tech customers soon won't need as many as they'd thought.
Many on Wall Street seemed to think so Monday as the stock went into a tailspin. (For its part, Nvidia seemed to shrug at the selloff in a statement to Bloomberg , calling DeepSeek's model an “excellent AI advancement” that “illustrates how new models can be created.”) .
It's also good to keep in mind that Wall Street is prone to tantrums, which is how some tech investors chalked up Monday's selloff.
“At the end of the day, there is only one chip company in the world launching autonomous, robotics, and broader AI use cases, and that is Nvidia,” Wedbush analysts wrote in a letter to clients.
“Launching a competitive LLM model for consumer use cases is one thing… launching broader AI infrastructure is a whole other ballgame, and nothing with DeepSeek makes us believe anything different.”.

Title: Digital humans: the relatable face of artificial intelligence?

# Digital humans: the relatable face of artificial intelligence?
| CNN Business.
London CNN — .
Scrolling through the Instagram account of DJ and aspiring model Dex you'll see her wearing new outfits, performing at shows around the world and chatting to her thousands of followers about her hobbies.
However, it's clear that there is something different about Dex; she's an entirely virtual “digital human,” designed by a startup in the UK.
For her performances, Dex is displayed on a video screen or as a holographic projection, with her mixes created by humans.
She is animated using Unreal Engine — a 3D modeling software widely used in video games — combined with motion-capture.
Generative artificial intelligence allows her to remember information and respond to questions, using a voice also generated by AI.
“She's probably one of the only digital humans in the performance space that you can have a conversation and interact with,” says Denise Harris, CCO of startup Sum Vivas.
“You can ask her anything.
She is a genius about music.”.
Last month, Dex performed at Digital Fashion Weeks in New York, Paris and Milan, and she has modeled outfits by Prada and Louis Vuitton at digital fashion events.
For Liverpool-based Sum Vivas she's a “showpiece” for more practical applications.
The company is now developing digital humans that can “listen” to people's questions and converse in real time.
“Shellie” can provide product information as an avatar on company websites, while “Arif” is set to direct passengers and answer questions as a multilingual concierge on screens at airports.
According to CEO and founder Rob Sims, digital humans can help bridge the gap between AI technology and people.
“What we've found is when people start working with and conversing with a digital human, they very quickly suspend disbelief,” Sims tells CNN.
“It becomes natural.”.
Since OpenAI's ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, considerable hype has surrounded the potential of generative AI — artificial intelligence powered by huge datasets of information, capable of generating text outputs in a conversational way.
Record levels of investment into generative AI have followed, with over $21 billion poured into the industry during the first nine months of last year, according to data insights company Pitchbook.
In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude.
As generative AI chatbots become increasingly ubiquitous, Sum Vivas is one of several companies looking to make them more human.
US and New Zealand-based UneeQ has developed animated conversational “digital humans” that can be used as virtual sales reps and customer service agents on company websites, and this month it debuted Sama 2.0, an animated cabin crew member that answers questions on Qatar Airways' website and app.
Microsoft recently announced that users of its Azure software would be able to create lifelike avatars capable of turning text prompts into animated speech.
However, there are widespread concerns about the impact AI could have on the job market. .
“When we rely on automated tools, what skills are we losing in the process?” asks Jennifer Ding, senior researcher at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK's national institute for data science and artificial intelligence.
“In some ways, we think of AI as something that's helping us or augmenting our work,” she says.
“However, alongside, this fear of replacement is bubbling up more and more.”.
Harris, however, points to new opportunities within digital human design and development.
“Every scenario that we found, we're creating jobs and working in harmony with people rather than taking away jobs,” she says.
“Digital humans, first and foremost, should work with other human colleagues,” adds Sims.
“We'll move into a stage where digital humans will start to become just another member of the team, with added benefits for that team, and obviously the customers they serve.”.

Title: FBI employees: Justice Department puts pressure on agents who worked on January 6 cases | CNN Politics
# FBI employees: Justice Department puts pressure on agents who worked on January 6 cases | CNN Politics.
CNN — .
The fate of thousands of FBI officials remains in the balance as the Justice Department is demanding they fill out a questionnaire about any involvement in investigating the January 6, 2021, US Capitol riot, a move employees believe is meant to be a precursor to mass firings.
The unusual demand for FBI employees to explain their role in an investigation comes as CNN has reported that President Donald Trump's Justice Department is considering expanding its purge of bureau personnel.
It's being met with considerable pushback, however, including potential lawsuits and legal advice to agents urging them not to resign.
The top agent in the FBI's New York field office, meanwhile, told his colleagues he's digging a foxhole to protect them.
“Do NOT resign or offer to resign,” the FBI Agents Association told members in an email obtained by CNN.
“While we would never advocate for physical non-compliance, you need to be clear your removal is not voluntary.”.
Separately, lawyers for prosecutors and FBI agents called the possible dismissal of employees who worked on Trump-related investigations a “violation of the due process rights” and threatened legal action in a letter to senior DOJ officials Sunday night.
“If you proceed with terminations and/or public exposure of terminated employees' identities, we stand ready to vindicate their rights through all available legal means,” the lawyers wrote to Emil Bove, the acting deputy attorney general.
The letter warns that should names of the agents become public, they would be subject to “immediate risk of doxing, swatting, harassment, or possibly worse.”.
Attorney Mark Zaid; Norm Eisen, executive chairman of the State Democracy Defenders Fund; and retired federal Judge Nancy Gertner signed the letter to Bove.
The letter comes a week after the Justice Department fired more than a dozen officials who worked on the federal criminal investigations into Trump.
A letter from acting Attorney General James McHenry to the officials said they cannot be “trusted” to “faithfully” implement Trump's agenda.
In addition to the questionnaire sent out from the DOJ, FBI leaders have been instructed to provide by Tuesday information about all current and former bureau employees who “at any time” worked on January 6 investigations.
On his first day in office, Trump issued a blanket pardon to those arrested and convicted for their roles in the violent US Capitol riot.
Perhaps the most passionate response has been from James Dennehy, the top leader of the FBI's New York field office, who told his staff he's preparing to “dig in” to defend them.
CNN obtained a copy of Dennehy's email, which reads in part:.
“I still remember the first time I dug a foxhole in the Marines, back in 1993.
I had nothing more than an E-tool (entrenching tool) that I carried around everywhere, which was a mini (2-foot long) shovel.
I dug with that damn thing all day long to build myself a 2-foot by 2-foot hole in the hard ground, about five feet deep.
It sucked.
But it worked.
That foxhole provided me the protection I needed for the battle that was to come, and when the bullets flew, it was worth the effort.
.
“Today, we find ourselves in the middle of a battle of our own, as good people are being walked out of the FBI and others are being targeted because they did their jobs in accordance with the law and FBI policy.
On a day like today, I find myself searching for my old E-tool, ready to put in the sweat and effort to dig that foxhole, as I have that feeling that I need to do right by this office.
.
“I will support each and every one of you with whatever personal decision you make, but I'm sticking around to defend you, your work, your families, and this team we call the Flagship.

Title: Aircraft disaster victim treatment was forever changed after TWA Flight 800.

# Aircraft disaster victim treatment was forever changed after TWA Flight 800.
| CNN.
CNN — .
In the days following the collision of a military helicopter and a passenger jet in Washington, DC, and the crash of a medevac jet in Philadelphia, federal investigators quickly expressed condolences to the families of the victims and partnered with non-profit groups to provide information and support.
It wasn't always that way.
As aviation authorities and transportation safety teams focused on recovering the wreckage and piecing together what might have caused the accidents, the families of the victims were often left frustrated by a lack of information and the slow pace of the investigations, which can often take a year.
Nearly 30 years ago, an airliner exploded shortly after departing New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, leaving authorities with a difficult and complex investigation and families demanding answers.
From the tragedy and the tireless efforts of advocates, an act of Congress mandated the government to offer support to families following airline disasters.
##### Photos: TWA Flight 800 .

Prev Next .
In 1996, Paris-bound TWA Flight 800 was carrying 230 people when it exploded minutes after taking off, killing everyone on board.
The plane's wreckage fell into the Atlantic Ocean off Long Island.
With help from the US Navy, the US Coast Guard and contracted fishing trawlers scouring the ocean floor, investigators were able to recover more than 95% of the aircraft, and, after almost a year, the remains of all who died were also recovered.
The tragedy prompted one of the largest and most expensive aviation investigations in history and set off a flurry of conspiracy theories, though the NTSB eventually deemed it an accident and found no evidence of foul play.
Following the 1996 TWA Flight 800 explosion and an exhaustive four-year investigation, Frank Hilldrup, an NTSB official who was on the original team of Flight 800 investigators, and his team determined the probable cause of the explosion was an electrical short, which detonated vapors in the center wing fuel tank, though they never definitively determined where the initial spark came from.
The family members of the Flight 800 tragedy reportedly struggled to get information from officials, while others seemingly understood the intricacy of the crash.
“We saw an enormous, tremendous amount of destruction,” Jose Cremades, a family member of one of the victims, said in 1997 while viewing the reconstructed wreckage from the airliner.
“The plane is really in small pieces, and we have understood today the complexity and the enormity of the task that both the FBI and the NTSB are facing.
And I think they're doing a wonderful job.”.
The explosion led to legislation, the Aviation Disaster Family Assistance Act , which would forever change the way plane accident victims' families and loved ones are treated.
“The Act requires air carriers to develop and maintain plans that address the needs of families of passengers involved in aircraft accidents,” according to a document from the National Transportation Safety Board.
“The law also requires that at a minimum the air carrier's plan should include the eighteen assurances outlined in the legislation.” .
Under the act, the NTSB “is responsible for coordinating federal government resources to support local, state, and tribal governments, disaster relief organizations, and the air carrier to meet the needs of families.” .
Peter Goelz, former managing director of the NTSB, told CNN in 2000 the Aviation Disaster Family Assistance Act was created when it “became clear to the NTSB and to the Congress and to others that families deserved more information and more targeted care after these kinds of disasters.”.
“So, when a disaster happens, family members get information from the government first, before the media.
They are briefed on a regular basis.
And what we're trying to do is not compound the tragedy,” Goelz said.
Following the collision in Washington, DC, the law was put into action by the NTSB.
Todd Inman with the agency on Friday said, “We did family briefings last night and today, there are over 100 family members that are now in the area receiving briefings.
And it's part of the legislative requirement receiving Family Assistance.”.
Inman said the families have been briefed by the medical examiner, fire chief, NTSB chairman and family assistant unit from the airline.
American Airlines said its CARE Team arrived at the scene before sunrise Thursday.
According to the company, the CARE team is a specially trained group that compassionately supports family members of the passengers and crew members in the aftermath of the accident.
“American has so far deployed 175 CARE Team members to Washington, D.C. and Wichita, Kansas.
All CARE Team members have been assigned to the families,” Andrea Koos, with American Airlines, said.
The CARE team, who are available 24/7 for families, also coordinates travel arrangements for family members and helps with accommodations for child care, elder care and pet care, the company said Saturday.
The legislation also tasks the NTSB with designating an “an independent nonprofit organization,” such as the American Red Cross, to coordinate “the emotional care, psychological care, and family support services” of those hurt in an accident or the family members of those hurt in an accident.
Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, who's been a vocal critic of congestion at Reagan National Airport, warning it was only a matter of time before there was a deadly collision, said he believes the NTSB will determine what led to Wednesday's incident.
“I do believe the NTSB will get to the bottom of it.
I have a feeling I know some of the things they will find.
I'm confident that they'll give us answers, and then that Congress and the administration together have to provide solutions following their recommendations,” Kaine told CNN's Jake Tapper on Sunday's “State of the Union.”.
Meanwhile, as the NTSB works to issue a preliminary report on the cause of the collision within 30 days, family members are dealing with their loss.
“I'm just so in shock right now,” Andy Beyer, whose daughter and wife were among the victims, told CNN.
“And there's like a place in my mind that I can't get near with all of the pain and grief.
It's like the door in my house to my daughter's room.
I just can't go anywhere near it.”.
CNN's Pete Muntean, Chris Boyette, Jessica Coacci, Taylor Galgano and Devan Cole contributed to this report.

Title: Trump's former Commerce Secretary says the president is unlikely to enact blanket tariffs | CNN Business
# Trump's former Commerce Secretary says the president is unlikely to enact blanket tariffs | CNN Business.
New York CNN — .
Since President Donald Trump won the election in November, businesses across the globe have been bracing for higher tariffs — a key Day One promise the president made.
But over a week into his presidency, Trump has yet to enact any new tariffs.
That could change, come 11:59 p.m. ET on Saturday — the deadline Trump set for when he says he will slap 25% tariffs on all Mexican and Canadian goods and a 10% tariff on all Chinese goods.
The tariffs, he said, will be imposed as a way of punishing the three nations, which Trump claims are responsible for helping people enter the country illegally and supplying fentanyl consumed in the US.
Speaking to reporters from the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump said he meant business, especially with his tariff threats on Mexico and Canada.
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt also confirmed on Friday that Trump will levy the 10% tariff on China on Saturday.
Should these threats be believed?
Yes and no, said Trump's former Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.
The threat of blanket tariffs is likely being overstated, Ross said in an interview with CNN.
“There probably will be exclusions, because there are some goods that just are not made here, will not be made here, and therefore, there's no particular point putting tariffs on.”.
Ross, who was one of a handful of initial cabinet members in Trump's first administration who kept their position for the entire four-year term, said he advocated for such exclusions when he advised Trump on tariff policies.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent supports a gradual approach as well as carving out exclusions for certain goods, he said in his confirmation hearing.
But Howard Lutnick, Trump's nominee to lead the Commerce Department, said he endorsed a blanket tariff approach.
There are pros and cons to both, said Ross.
“When we put the steel tariffs in, we got 11,000 requests for exclusions.
There aren't 11,000 legitimate requests,” Ross said, referring to the 25% tariff Trump levied on steel imported from most countries to the US in 2018 unless they satisfied certain qualifying exemption criteria.
Many of those requests were denied, he added.
In addition, exclusions for certain countries' products or certain goods quickly created “a series of whack-a-moles,” he said.
“Every time you put something in, all these clever minds overseas will do their best to figure out: How do I get around it?
Do I get around it with transshipment?
Do I get around it with some trivial modification?
” Ross said.
That's why he sees some value to Trump pursuing, in some instances, blanket tariffs.
Ross, known in the business world to many as the “king of bankruptcy” for his ability to acquire virtually defunct businesses and transform them into profitable enterprises that he'd later sell off, said Trump “means business all the time” when it comes to threats he makes.
However, there's some speculation that Trump may be using tariffs as a negotiation tactic and won't follow through.
This was the case last weekend with Colombia.
Hours after Trump ordered steep tariffs on Colombian goods after the nation initially refused to accept planes with deported migrants, the tariffs were taken off the table.
The White House released a statement saying Colombia agreed to “all of President Trump's terms.” .
That's likely going to be a common experience with other countries Trump vows to impose tariffs on, said Ross.
“Sometimes you can get most of what you need without tariffs.”.
For instance, Ross said that with the help of US ambassadors to the European Union and Belgium, he was able to convince leaders of European car companies to build more auto production facilities in the US in exchange for avoiding tariffs on their cars.
As to what Trump will sign into law this weekend, “nobody really knows what he will do,” Ross said at an event hosted by the Japan Society last week.
Trump understands that “fear of the unknown is the most powerful fear that there is,” and he is fully leveraging that, Ross said.

Title: Otaru: Snowy Japanese town faces overtourism challenges | CNN
# Otaru: Snowy Japanese town faces overtourism challenges | CNN.
CNN — .
Tranquil and blanketed in pristine white snow, the Japanese city of Otaru serves as the backdrop of a popular 1995 romance blockbuster that continues to bring starry-eyed travelers to the region every winter.
But this sleepy city tucked away on the west coast of the island of Hokkaido has become the latest flashpoint in Japan's ongoing battle against overtourism.
Local authorities recently deployed security guards to remind tourists to refrain from unruly behaviors, including trespassing onto private premises and obstructing road traffic.
The increased focus on foreign travelers follows the death of a Hong Kong woman on the outskirts of Otaru.
The 61-year-old tourist was hit and killed by a train on January 24 while reportedly snapping photos on the tracks at Asari Station, known for its view of the coastline juxtaposed by trains passing through the snow.
However, Otaru City Hall officials told CNN tourists had been causing disruptions since before the traveler's death.
Otaru, which has a population of about 100,000 people, recorded 98,678 overnight international visitors last year, the highest number on record.
That figure doesn't include those making day trips from Sapporo, Hokkaido's capital, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) southeast.
Parts of Japanese director Shunji Iwai's “Love Letter” — a film in which the death of a man brings his fiancé and his high school crush together to retrace his life — were shot there.
Funamizaka is one particular area that rocketed to unwanted fame after being featured in the film.
The neighborhood offers an elevated view of a quintessential Japanese street lined with wooden houses with snow piled up on their doors.
At the end of the slope is a panoramic view of the Sea of Japan.
Since late last month, City Hall has deployed three security guards to Funamizaka to display banners warning against bad tourist behavior.
The security personnel also reminded visitors that littering and obstructing roads are prohibited and that offenders will be fined, officials told CNN.
During peak hours, local police have also been deployed to assist in managing the area.
The security measures will last until at least March 31, Otaru officials said.
Local media have reported that staff are handing out warnings in English, Chinese and Korean.
Security was beefed up ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday period when Chinese tourists often travel overseas.
On Chinese social media app Xiaohongshu , or Red Note, posts of how to re-create the best angles from the movie abound.
“Because of your letter, I came to Otaru,” one user wrote in a post last week, adding tips to get the best angle of Funamizaka.
The line references a plot point of the “Love Letter” movie.
Another user posted a video of Tenguyama, a mountain featured in the film.
“The snow in Hokkaido is my love letter to winter this year,” she wrote.
An Otaru City Hall official told CNN that the security measures are not aimed at the rise of Chinese tourists specifically but are a response to the overall jump in international visitors.
Residents of Otaru aren't the only group in Japan getting frustrated about the added attention.
In May last year, Fujikawaguchiko , a small town at the base of Mount Fuji, had to erect a large black net to block the view of a popular photo spot at a convenience store.
The store, which is set against the mountain, was attracting a daily tourist scrum that inconvenienced residents.
The net was removed in August after the craze subsided.
Some well-known tourist destinations have also implemented measures to control the growing flow of tourists.
Ginzan Onsen, a popular Japanese hot spring town known for its scenic snowy views, began limiting entry to day trippers during peak season in December last year.
Located in the Yamagata region about 260 miles north of Tokyo, the town is famous for its picturesque scenery, including traditional Edo-period buildings blanketed in snow — speculated to be the inspiration for Oscar-winning animator Hayao Miyazaki's film “Spirited Away.”.
Other places such as Mount Fuji and Himeji Castle — Japan's largest castle, located in western Hyogo Prefecture - are proposing to raise entry fees for visitors.

Title: Queensland flooding: Australia braces for more destruction as deadly floods devastate northeast | CNN
# Queensland flooding: Australia braces for more destruction as deadly floods devastate northeast | CNN.
CNN — .
Deadly floodwaters triggered by record rainfall in Australia's northeast rose for a third day Monday as authorities warned flood-stricken communities to brace themselves for further destruction.
One person drowned in the flooding on Sunday and thousands of residents in low-lying coastal suburbs and towns are under immediate evacuation orders after nearly a summer's worth of rain fell on large parts of North Queensland in just a few days.
Impacted areas are dotted along the 735-kilometer (456 mile) stretch of the Queensland coast from Cairns - a gateway to the Great Barrier Reef - to Mackay, with the city of Townsville, Ingham town, and Cardwell among the worst hit by flash floods and overflowing rivers.
“To see the level of devastation in that community is very difficult,” Queensland Premier David Crisafulli said of Ingham on Monday, adding that homes, businesses and the agricultural sector have been badly damaged.
“That is a very strong and resilient community, but this is a flood the likes of which is only seen a handful of times,” he said.
The Australian Bureau of Meteorology extended a severe weather warning on Monday for large parts of the coast, saying “severe thunderstorms with heavy to intense rainfall are possible today.”
Some areas have seen up to a meter of rainfall in the past week, and major flood warnings have been issued for areas along six rivers that are running well above flood levels.
A woman in her 60s died in Ingham after a rescue boat she was traveling in capsized after hitting a tree on Sunday morning, according to CNN affiliate Nine News .
State Disaster Coordinator Shane Chelepy said the woman was one of six people on the boat, with the five others rescued.
In an update on Monday, Chelepy said there have been no further fatalities, and no people reported missing since Sunday.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called the death “heartbreaking news,” in a post on X. “My thoughts are with the family and the entire community at this awful time,” he said, adding that the federal government “will supply whatever resources are required to deal with this event.”.
Meanwhile, Queensland's Department of Environment, Science and Innovation has warned residents to be wary of crocodiles that could be lurking in the floodwaters, according to Nine News .
“During flooding crocodiles can turn up in places they haven't been seen before as they move about in search of calmer waters,” the department said in a statement.
“Expect crocodiles in all north and far north Queensland waterways even if there is no warning sign.”.
State Disaster Coordinator Chelepy said Monday that officials had received 480 calls for assistance overnight - the most reported in recent days - as well as multiple emergency alerts and reports of flash flooding.
Response teams made 11 swift water rescues of people stranded in their homes or trapped in vehicles from the rising waters, Chelepy said.
In hard-hit Townsville, six low-lying suburbs have been designated as a “black zone” and residents there have evacuated.
More than 400 people have taken refuge in six evacuation centers set up to house those who had to flee their homes, authorities said.
The city of about 200,000 people was hit by devastating flooding in 2019 which was labeled by the then state premier as a “one-in-100-year event.” .
Crisafulli said Sunday that this weekend's rains could match those conditions.
“Take precautions, prepare for the worst, listen to the advice.
This is a serious event,” he said.
An emergency alert was issued Sunday for the small coastal community of Bluewater, north of Townsville, with local disaster-response officials telling residents “your life may be at risk.”.
“Water is rising fast and there will be dangerous and life-threatening flooding,” Townsville Local Disaster Management Group said.
“If you do not leave it may become too dangerous for emergency services to rescue you.”.
Relief and rescue efforts have been hampered after a bridge collapsed along the Bruce Highway, a major road that runs from the south to the far north of the state.
“The north and all of regional Queensland are at the mercy of one road,” Premier Crisafulli said.
“There is an opportunity through disaster to build back better.”.
The flooding comes after days of torrential rain and damaging winds brought on by two low pressure tropical systems, according to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology.
Intense rain events are also getting heavier and more frequent as the world warms due to fossil fuel pollution and the consequences of the climate crisis worsens extreme weather.
Relief is in sight as the rainfall is expected to ease in the coming days but residents in several areas have been warned to expect more life-threatening rain and major floods on Monday.
“This is a significant and protracted weather event that we're seeing with record breaking rainfall in many locations,” Matthew Collopy, senior meteorologist at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, said Monday.
“There is already an incredible amount of water on the ground, there is more significant rain to come.
So it will take days for that water to come out of those systems.”.
Months' worth of rain has fallen over the past few days, with the rural town of Rollingstone recording 1,280 millimeters (50.3 inches) over the past week.
Rainfall totals of 600 mm (about 23 inches) have also been recorded in places between Innisfail and Townville, according to the bureau.
“More than six months worth of rain was recorded in the past three days in and around Townsville,” the bureau said in a post on X.
Ingham Airport, which closed on Sunday, has seen over 830 mm (32 inches) of rainfall since Friday and nearly 1,000 mm (40 inches) of rainfall in the past week.
A nearby weather station shows the area has had nearly a summer's worth of rain in that time, with the bulk of it falling in the past few days.
The hard-hit town of Cardwell has been drenched with more rain in the past 24 hours than its entire February average, with 490 mm (19.3 inches) falling in the past day.
And Paluma Dam saw 712 mm (28.03 inches) of rainfall Friday to Saturday morning and another 500 mm (20 inches) of rainfall Sunday to Monday morning, which is well over a meter of rainfall since Friday.
The intense rains have swelled rivers beyond their flood levels and authorities have begun releasing water through spillways on the Ross River Dam to relieve pressure.
Though river levels in some areas have begun falling, the bureau said.

Title: Elon Musk says SpaceX will bring home Starliner astronauts — NASA announced that plan months ago | CNN
# Elon Musk says SpaceX will bring home Starliner astronauts - NASA announced that plan months ago | CNN.
CNN — .
In a post on the social media platform X, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk claimed Tuesday that the Biden Administration left two astronauts “stranded” and said President Donald Trump has asked SpaceX to step in to rescue them.
But NASA already put such a plan in place months ago when it asked SpaceX to return astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore from the International Space Station as part of its Crew-9 mission .
A delay in that plan was then announced in December because mission teams said they needed more time to prepare a new SpaceX vehicle.
“The @POTUS has asked @SpaceX to bring home the 2 astronauts stranded on the @Space_Station as soon as possible.
We will do so,” Musk's post reads. “
Terrible that the Biden administration left them there so long.” .
In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, President Trump reiterated the remark, saying “the 2 brave astronauts who have been virtually abandoned in space by the Biden Administration.”.
“They have been waiting for many months on @Space Station,” the post reads.
“Elon will soon be on his way.
Hopefully, all will be safe.
Good luck Elon!!!”.
When asked for comment about the ambiguous declarations from Musk and Trump, NASA replied that it is “expeditiously working to safely return the agency's SpaceX Crew-9 astronauts,” as move that, in the agency's words, will take place “as soon as practical.”.
It's still not clear whether, at the behest of the Trump administration, the agency will make any adjustments to the schedule it has had in place for weeks.
NASA did not respond to follow-up questions Wednesday.
CNN also reached out to SpaceX and the White House for comment.
Neither immediately responded.
While Williams and Wilmore's situation is unusual, with the two astronauts unable to return home on the Boeing spacecraft that took them to the space station, their return trip is slated to be relatively routine, as they are due to fly home with other astronauts as part of a scheduled crew rotation.
Williams and Wilmore piloted the first crewed mission of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, which launched from Florida in June 2024 and experienced a rocky journey to the ISS.
The astronauts were initially slated to spend about a week at the orbiting laboratory.
After Starliner arrived at the space station, NASA and Boeing worked for weeks to better understand the problems — including helium leaks and propulsion issues — that plagued the first leg of the test mission.
NASA ultimately decided it was too risky to return Starliner with crew.
And the agency announced last August that it was asking SpaceX to bring Williams and Wilmore home aboard the SpaceX Crew-9 capsule.
That vehicle is currently docked with the space station, where Williams and Wilmore have become official members of the ISS staff as they await their return home.
NASA previously said that the Crew-9 capsule would return home as soon as February.
But the agency updated that timeline in December, saying that SpaceX needed more time to complete the capsule it would use for the Crew-10 mission, which, following NASA's precedence, would need to launch before Crew-9 leaves the ISS.
At the time, the agency said Crew-9 would target its return no earlier than late March .
In its statement Wednesday, NASA indicated the Crew-9 spacecraft would not return home with Williams and Wilmore before Crew-10 arrives at the ISS.
Such a move would leave just one astronaut — NASA's Don Pettit, who flew to the station aboard a Russian Soyuz vehicle — to manage the entire US-controlled section of the ISS.
Crew-9 will return home “as soon as practical,” the space agency's statement reads, “while also preparing for the launch of Crew-10 to complete a handover between expeditions.”.
In a statement to CNN, former NASA Administrator Bill Nelson — who helmed the agency under Biden and stepped down from the post when Trump took office earlier this month — said, “SpaceX will bring Butch and Suni back on a Dragon spacecraft as Crew 9 on a regular rotation after Crew 10 has arrived.
The handover from one crew to the other is important to maintain the ISS and keep all astronauts safe.”.
While acknowledging that there have been difficult parts of their mission, Williams and Willmore appeared in good spirits during a January 8 interview from the space station.
“We have plenty of clothes.
We are well fed,” Wilmore said.
Williams added, “It's just a great team and — no, it doesn't feel like we're castaways.
“Eventually we want to go home,” she added, “because we left our families a little while ago, but we have a lot to do while we're up here.”.
Williams completed a spacewalk last week and both Williams and Wilmore are scheduled to venture out of the ISS for another spacewalk Thursday.
Since mission teams began the long process of evaluating the Starliner spacecraft's issues — and ultimately deciding to bring Williams and Wilmore home on a SpaceX capsule — officials at both NASA and Boeing have insisted that the astronauts were never stranded.
Steve Stich, NASA's commercial crew program manager, noted during a news conference last year that Williams and Wilmore always had the option to fly home on Starliner in case of an emergency or, once the SpaceX Crew-9 vehicle arrived, to get back to Earth aboard that vessel.
“In my view, they're never stuck or stranded,” Stich said.
“They always had a way to depart the space station.
And to me, when somebody is stranded, there's a location where they cannot leave.”.
In an interview with CNN last week, Nelson, the former NASA chief, spoke in depth about the decision to extend the astronauts' stay in space, emphasizing that the decision was made with astronaut safety top of mind — and despite Boeing's objections.
Among NASA leadership, the decision announced in August to fly Williams and Wilmore home on a SpaceX Crew Dragon rather than Starship was unanimous.
”Pam (Melroy, the deputy administrator, and) the number three position at NASA, Bob Cabana, had all flown in space — the three of us,” Nelson said.
“So all three of us were enormously impacted by the experiences that we had had (with the Columbia and Challenger disasters), and as a result of that, we have absolutely insisted on as much safety as we could have — and we have pounded that message.”.
Nelson added, “At the end, there was a disagreement with Boeing.
Boeing thought it was safe for them to come back on the Starliner.
But NASA was unanimous in saying that they should not return on Starliner.”.
That's why the agency opted to bring the astronauts home on SpaceX's Crew-9..
### What's next for Butch and Suni .
SpaceX's Crew-9 mission, which also includes NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov among its crew, arrived at the orbiting outpost in September.
Williams and Wilmore have now been on the station for more than seven months, and they will have tallied up roughly nine months in space if they return home in late March or early April.
Routine missions to the International Space Station regularly last six months.
But it's not uncommon for astronauts to get an unexpected extension while in orbit — for days, weeks or even months.
NASA astronaut Frank Rubio, for example, holds the US record for the longest continuous stay on the space station.
He spent 371 days there on a mission that ended in 2023.

Title: Mexican president says she sent letter to Google contesting Gulf of Mexico name change | CNN
# Mexican president says she sent letter to Google contesting Gulf of Mexico name change | CNN.
Mexico City CNN — .
Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum sent a letter to Google contesting the tech giant's decision to comply with US President Donald Trump's order to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America.
President Sheinbaum showed the letter to reporters Thursday saying, “In the case of Mexico, where are we completely sovereign?
In the area established as 12 nautical miles from the coastline, and this applies to all countries worldwide.”.
“If a country wants to change the designation of something in the sea, it would only apply up to 12 nautical miles.
It cannot apply to the rest, in this case, the Gulf of Mexico.
This is what we explained in detail to Google.”.
Referring to a previous counterproposal she made to Trump to rename the US, Sheinbaum added, “In the end, we requested that when someone searches for 'América Mexicana' in the search engine, the map we previously presented should appear.”
That map, from 1607, labeled parts of North America “Mexican America” and was shown during a press conference earlier this month.
On Monday, Google announced that Google Maps users in the US would see the body of water known as the Gulf of Mexico renamed as the Gulf of America.
Google said its move was in line with its “practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government sources.”.
Users in Mexico will continue to see the “Gulf of Mexico” on Google Maps.
The rest of the world will see both names.
Google will also change the name of Mount McKinley, the nation's highest peak, from Denali.
Former President Barack Obama renamed the Alaska landmark to Denali in 2015 as a nod to the region's native population.
Both changes stem from an executive action that Trump signed shortly after taking office last week, saying the changes “honor American greatness.”.
“It is in the national interest to promote the extraordinary heritage of our Nation and ensure future generations of American citizens celebrate the legacy of our American heroes,” the executive order said.

Title: Taylor Swift: MMA fighter on sharing his name with a global superstar | CNN
# Taylor Swift: MMA fighter on sharing his name with a global superstar | CNN.
CNN — .
One is an American superstar boasting hundreds of millions of social media followers, the other is an amateur fighter from England who works part-time as an electrician, but these two people share one very important thing in common - both are called Taylor Swift .
Sharing a name with a global megastar might be a bonus for some, but for a rising mixed martial arts (MMA) star, it can make things a little awkward.
“Once I started fighting, there was no avoiding it.
It literally gets shouted out in the arena,” Swift (the MMA fighter) told CNN Sport's Don Riddell.
“It gets the odd little chuckle from a few people from the crowd.
At weigh-ins as well, especially at amateur (level), all the fighters are in the same room and they get called up.
As soon as mine is called, it gets a few laughs.”.
Swift, 21, has seen his profile rocket in recent weeks after people discovered his rather special name.
He's been peppered with requests from the media but has decided to embrace the newfound fame.
Swift said he became aware of the other Swift's music when he was around 10 years old, and explained it's something he's struggled to shake off as he got older, and she got more famous.
He said it's particularly problematic in places such as doctors' waiting rooms, when he's waiting for the inevitable jokes as soon as his name is called.
While admitting he's not a huge fan of her music, he said people still try to persuade him to use her songs while walking out to his fights - although he's so far resisted that.
Swift is very much in the infancy of his MMA career having only had four fights to date - with another coming up on March 8.
He knows all too well that he has plenty to learn but still holds lofty ambitions of one day turning professional and even making it to the UFC.
“You have to have a lot of heart, especially as an amateur.
It can be very tiring,” he said, explaining he tried other forms of fighting before his love story with MMA began.
“It's very real.
It's very in the moment.
It's like a sort of out of body experience, but you don't have time to think about it when someone is trying to punch your head in.
It's one of the best feelings in the world, especially when you're winning.”.
Swift said he has no desire to change his name and has learnt to style it out, hoping it might attract more sponsors to help his career in the future.
He's also keen to learn lessons from his slightly more famous counterpart, especially when it comes to performing in front of a crowd.
That said, if he ever did meet the other Swift, he said he would have one tiny request.
“I'd ask if she could change her name for starters,” he laughed.
“Might ask her to borrow some followers as well.”.

Title: Trump's under-the-radar Alaska order has environmentalists on edge | CNN Business
# Trump's under-the-radar Alaska order has environmentalists on edge | CNN Business.
CNN — .
One of President Donald Trump's sweeping executive orders has reignited a debate over the future of Alaska's vast wilderness and resources, sparking deep concern among some environmental groups and Indigenous communities.
Trump on his first day in office signed an executive order focused on “unleashing Alaska's extraordinary resource potential.”
It includes a directive to develop Alaska's energy and mineral resources “to the fullest extent possible.” .
The executive order has been lauded by state officials and industry leaders who hope to take advantage of Alaska's drilling and mining potential.
But environmentalists and some Indigenous Alaskans have warned of the negative impact on the state's wilderness, wildlife and local subsistence lifestyles.
While oil and gas drilling are a focus of Trump's executive order, it has major implications for mining in a remote region of the Last Frontier state.
The order includes reviewing a project called the Ambler Road, a proposed industrial route that would stretch 211 miles across northwest Alaska to explore the potential to build mines for extracting minerals like copper and cobalt.
It's a reversal of a Biden administration decision from June 2024 that halted the project due to environmental concerns.
Trump's order reinstates a decision published in July 2020 during his first term that had affirmed the project.
A spokesperson for the Interior Department said in a statement to CNN that the department is “working to expeditiously implement the President's Executive Order.”.
Alaska Governor Mike Dunleavy sent a letter to Trump in December highlighting a wish list of priorities related to the state, including reviewing the Ambler Road project, and Alaska Senators Dan Sullivan and Lisa Murkowski, both Republicans, have applauded Trump's order.
Project 2025, the controversial conservative blueprint for a second Trump term, mentioned advancing the Ambler Road as a policy agenda.
Yet, any developments are expected to face legal challenges.
Alex Johnson, a campaign director for the National Parks Conservation Association, an advocacy group, said in a statement, “There's no escaping the disastrous impacts of this mining road on the clean water, people, wildlife and national parks.”.
## Cobalt and critical minerals .
The US Geological Survey designates 50 minerals as “critical” to the US economy and national security.
Alaska is home to 49 of 50 of these critical minerals, meaning the state is at the forefront of efforts to build a domestic supply chain, said Lee Ann Munk, a professor of geosciences at the University of Alaska Fairbanks and director of the Alaska Critical Minerals Collaborative .
Critical minerals have surged in popularity in recent years because they are used to build technologies involved with renewable energy, like batteries for electric vehicles.
Cobalt, for example, is used in EV batteries, in addition to semiconductor chips and mobile phones.
Critical minerals like antimony are also used for military equipment and defense systems.
While Trump has shown no interest in a green energy transition, members of his administration like Secretary of State Marco Rubio have previously been outspoken about the need for critical minerals, according to Jef Caers, a professor of earth and planetary sciences at Stanford University.
“Securing critical minerals has very large bipartisan support in and outside Congress,” Caers added.
The US currently relies on global supply chains to buy these minerals for cheap.
The nation's first and only cobalt mine opened in Idaho in 2023 before halting production due to a price slump in the market that made the mine unprofitable.
The US relies entirely on imports for 12 critical minerals and is over 50% reliant on imports for 29 others, according to the 2024 US Geological Survey .
There have been bipartisan efforts in Congress to develop the supply of critical minerals in the US, particularly to move away from supply chains based in the Democratic Republic of Congo and processing plants in China due to concerns of labor and human rights abuses.
In 2023, the DRC accounted for 77% of the global cobalt mine supply, according to data from Darton Commodities, a critical minerals company.
Additionally, China produced 79% of all refined cobalt in 2023.
“Since most cobalt is mined in the DRC and influenced by China, including the processing of the ore in cobalt, this is a considerable supply chain issue,” Stanford's Caers said.
In 2022, the Biden administration invoked the Defense Production Act to expedite the production of critical minerals like cobalt and nickel.
“The potential to increase the domestic supply of all of these minerals, but in particular minerals such as cobalt, I can see why that is viewed in Washington as an overall benefit to our industrial base,” Adam Simon, a professor of earth and environmental sciences at the University of Michigan, told CNN.
While there are mines across the US, including in Alaska, a vast swath of northern Alaska called the Ambler district has yet to be mined.
The Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, a state-owned company that proposed the Ambler Road, said in a statement that it “strongly supports and appreciates the Executive Orders issued by President Trump.”.
The road is designated to be used by Ambler Metals, a mining company based in Alaska that is jointly owned by the Canadian company Trilogy Metals ( TMQ ) and the Australian company South32.
Shares in Trilogy Metals have surged since Trump's reelection in November.
Ambler Metals has a partnership with the Northwest Arctic Native Association (NANA), a company that represents Inupiat Alaska Natives.
NANA declined CNN's request for comment.
“President Trump's executive order provides a pathway for the United States to develop a domestic supply of minerals from the Amber Mining District that are critical for our economy and national security,” said Kaleb Froehlich, managing director of Ambler Metals, in a statement.
The Ambler Road project would be constructed in an area of Alaska with little to no prior development, causing drastic changes to the region, according to Liliana Diaz, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council Global Energy Center.
Building the road would involve establishing nearly 50 bridges of varying sizes, in addition to airstrips, maintenance sites, communication towers and other items, according to the Bureau of Land Management's June 2024 environmental impact statement .
“The economics of this road will depend on whether the mining project is successful and can actually be profitable into the future, and whether the economic value that it brings outweighs the environmental costs that it will create,” Diaz said.
“It's based on uncertainty, whereas the environmental costs of developing a piece of infrastructure will be filled as the infrastructure is actually developed and laid down,” she added.
Karmen Monigold, an Alaskan Indigenous Inupiaq and subsistence provider, told CNN that she thinks the industrial development of the Ambler region would mean the destruction of her tribe's culture and their subsistence lifestyle.
Monigold was born and raised in Kotzebue, Alaska.
She traveled to Washington, DC, in the past year to advocate for blocking the Ambler Road project.
“Our people rely heavily on our culture, and that is why we are against this road, because it would devastate our culture,” Monigold said.
Tanana Chiefs Conference, a consortium of 39 villages and 37 federally recognized tribes in Alaska, said in a statement that it “continues to honor Tribal resolutions opposing the Ambler Road Access Project and advocating for the protection of subsistence resources.” .
“We will engage in discussions regarding the review of land policies to ensure Alaska Native rights are respected,” the statement added.
To be sure, some Indigenous communities are in support of the project.
Proponents of the Ambler Road project expect it will usher in new jobs to the region.
Jim Dau, a caribou biologist who worked for decades for the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, told CNN that he expects the 211-mile road would negatively impact the migration pattern of caribou in northwest Alaska, posing irrevocable issues for Indigenous communities that rely on the herds each season.
“With the economic benefits of industrial mining up there, there's always costs,” Dau said.
“How much is an Indigenous culture worth?
How much is a caribou herd worth?
There are so many intangible aspects to things that surround this Ambler Road, things like cultural identity (and) traditional subsistence lifestyles.”.

Title: A trans National Guard pilot was falsely accused of flying the helicopter in the fatal plane collision | CNN Business
# A trans National Guard pilot was falsely accused of flying the helicopter in the fatal plane collision | CNN Business.
CNN — .
A trans member of the National Guard is speaking out after a wave of claims on social media falsely pointed to her as the pilot of the Black Hawk helicopter that collided with a passenger jet in Washington, Wednesday, killing 67 people.
Jo Ellis, a UH60 Black Hawk helicopter pilot for the Virginia Army National Guard, posted on Facebook Friday to dispel the rumors that had echoed President Donald Trump's unsubstantiated blaming of diversity initiatives for the fatal accident.
“Some craziness has happened on the internet and I'm being named as one of the pilots of the DC crash,” Ellis wrote.
“It's insulting to the victims and families of those lost and they deserve better than this BS from the bots and trolls of the internet.”.
In her Facebook post, Ellis shared a screenshot of two X posts that linked her being trans to the catastrophic crash, with one user saying they “wouldn't be surprised” if “the pilot was trans” in response to another post that claimed Ellis “has been making radicalized anti-Trump statements on socials.
The latter account has since deleted the post and published an apology .
A separate account, which has a blue checkmark and 13,600 followers, shared a now-deleted post directly attacking Ellis and spreading the bogus conspiracy theory.
While the account has likewise issued a correction , the post still raked in at least 195,000 views and was reshared almost 1,000 times before being deleted.
At the time of both corrections, “Jo Ellis” was the No. 3 trending topic on X, with 19,400 posts.
And, despite Ellis' correction — which she further addressed in a follow-up Facebook video , captioned “proof of life” — far-right accounts on X have continued to spread misinformation and hate speech.
Ellis' erroneous scapegoating in far-right circles follows the ﻿guardswoman's publicized sit-down with CNN's Michael Smerconish, slated to appear in Saturday's episode of “The Smerconish Podcast” during which she discussed her service and experiences with gender dysphoria.
In an essay for Smerconish's newsletter , Ellis also discussed her story, writing about transitioning while serving in the military.
Hate speech following the crash echoed recent attacks from Trump on DEI initiatives and executive actions targeting transgender Americans.
Since returning to the Oval Office, Trump has repeatedly taken aim at transgender people, saying in his inauguration speech “that there are only two genders: male and female.”
Amid his flurry of executive orders, Trump has also re-banned transgender Americans from serving in the military , reviving his 2017 order that was repealed by then-President Joe Biden in 2021 .
And, in his first White House briefing room address , Trump directly linked the crash to DEI while also blaming initiatives from Democrats.
“We must have only the highest standards for those who work in our aviation system,” Trump said.
“I changed the Obama standards from very mediocre at best to extraordinary, you remember that.”.
“Only the highest aptitude, they have to be the highest intellect and psychologically superior people, were allowed to qualify for air traffic controllers,” he said.
In a Thursday White House memo , Trump blamed the Obama administration's implementation of “a biographical questionnaire at the FAA to shift the hiring focus away from objective aptitude,” further linking the crash to DEI initiatives.
“The Biden Administration egregiously rejected merit-based hiring, requiring all executive departments and agencies to implement dangerous 'diversity equity and inclusion' tactics, and specifically recruiting individuals with “severe intellectual” disabilities in the FAA,” Trump wrote in the memo.
Neither the memo nor Trump's press conference provided any evidence to support his brazen claims.
When one reporter pressed the president for an explanation of his diversity claims during the press conference, Trump again failed to provide evidence, responding simply: “Because common sense and unfortunately a lot of people don't.”.
Baseless DEI attacks have become one of the key pillars of the president's MAGA platform, and Trump is far from alone in linking disasters to diversity initiatives.
When disastrous wildfires erupted in California, Elon Musk used his X pulpit to claim “DEI means people DIE,” while others took aim at Karen Bass , the first woman and second black person to serve as Los Angeles mayor.
Conservatives likewise blamed Kristin Crowley , the city's first woman and openly gay fire chief, for the wildfires that killed 28 people.
Other incidents have also been linked to DEI initiatives.
Rep. Dan Meuser told Fox News that the New Orleans' New Years Day tragedy was because “the priority of the last four years has been DEI, not IEDs.”
And Phil Lyman , the one-time Maryland gubernatorial hopeful, blamed the Baltimore Key Brdieg disaster on “governors who prioritize diversity.” .

Title: Painting found at garage sale is a Van Gogh, experts say | CNN
# Painting found at garage sale is a Van Gogh, experts say | CNN.
CNN — .
A painting bought at a garage sale in Minnesota is a previously unknown portrait by Dutch artist Vincent Van Gogh , according to a newly published expert analysis.
It was made by Van Gogh during his stay at a psychiatric hospital in the south of France in 1889, experts commissioned by art research firm LMI Group International have said after analyzing the canvas weave, paint pigment and other characteristics.
Acquired by an antiques collector in 2016, the painting bears an inscription of the word “Elimar” in the bottom right corner.
Measuring 45.7 centimeters by 41.9 centimeters (18 inches by 16.5 inches), experts identified the painting as a Van Gogh following a process that took four years.
The oil on canvas painting is a portrait of a fisherman with a white beard, smoking a pipe as he repairs his net.
It is based on a painting by Danish artist Michael Ancher (1849-1927), according to LMI, and is one of many of Van Gogh's “translations” of works by other artists.
Researchers also found a hair embedded in the canvas and sent it to be analyzed.
Although it was found to be from a human male, efforts to match its DNA with descendants of Van Gogh were thwarted by its “degraded state,” said LMI.
“By integrating science and technology with traditional tools of connoisseurship, historical context, formal analysis, and provenance research, we aim both to expand and tailor the resources available for art authentication based on the unique properties of the works under our care,” said Lawrence M. Shindell, chairman, president and chief executive officer of LMI Group, in a press release this week.
Despite the exhaustive analysis, the painting still needs to be attributed to Van Gogh by the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
The museum previously refused to attribute the painting to Van Gogh when approached by the previous owner in December 2018.
However, LMI, which acquired the painting in 2019, is confident that it is genuine.
“The discovery of a previously unknown van Gogh painting should come as no surprise,” reads the report.
“It is well-known that van Gogh lost many works, gave away works to friends and was not particularly careful about any work he considered a study, of which there were many.”.
LMI said in the release that the painting “is an emotionally rich, profoundly personal work created during the final and tumultuous chapter of van Gogh's life.”.
The Dutch master produced some 900 paintings during his lifetime.
He is thought to have suffered from a combination of bipolar and borderline personality disorder, though these illnesses were never diagnosed.
In 2020, researchers from The University Medical Center Groningen, in the Netherlands, said that they believed Van Gogh experienced two brief psychotic episodes, presumed to be delirium caused by alcohol withdrawal, following his admission to hospital after cutting off his own ear with a razor in 1888.
Van Gogh died by suicide in 1890 at the age of 37.

Title: In the face of a trade war with America's neighbors, Trump blinked | CNN Politics
# In the face of a trade war with America's neighbors, Trump blinked | CNN Politics.
CNN — .
There are two things to remember when assessing Donald Trump's presidencies.
First, nothing is more important than the commander in chief looking tough.
Second, nothing is really what it seems.
Trump's classic political method is already on full display in his second presidency and helps explain the baffling chaos, brinkmanship and posturing of his tariff showdown with Canada and Mexico.
Punishing 25% levies on imports from America's closest neighbors were due to come into force at 12:01 a.m. ET Tuesday, but Trump put his two-front trade war on hold, claiming he'd scored two big wins and major concessions.
But despite a White House victory lap, there's a more convincing case that it was really Trump who backed away from a fight that could have caused severe economic pain.
Trump does have some bragging rights.
He campaigned on strengthening America's northern and southern borders and demanded Canada and Mexico do more to cut the flow of undocumented migrants and fentanyl.
After Trump spoke to President Claudia Sheinbaum on Monday, she announced she'd send 10,000 Mexican troops to the border.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau agreed to name a fentanyl czar, set up a joint US-Canada border task force and spend $1.3 billion on helicopters and technology to secure the 49th Parallel.
“As President, it is my responsibility to ensure the safety of ALL Americans, and I am doing just that,” Trump wrote on Truth Social after putting tariffs on hold for 30 days to see how the “deals” he forged with Canada and Mexico play out.
Pro-Trump media proclaimed famous victories.
“Mexico and Canada buckle,” Fox News declared in a chyron.
“Canada Caves,” said Breitbart News, adding, “Art of the Deal: Trump already won the trade war with Mexico for USA.”.
For the White House, Trump had racked up wins, and in “America First” mode, bullied foreign states into submission.
“Canada is bending the knee, just like Mexico,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told CNN.
This was a stunning insult coming from a press aide with no diplomatic responsibility.
It also suggested deep contempt for Canada, especially in the White House of a president who demands it become the 51st state.
But what did Trump get?
What did it cost?
And will it last?.
A more objective view of the bizarre showdown with America's neighbors suggests a blunter truth: Trump blinked.
The president vowed as recently as last week that there was nothing that Canada or Mexico could do to avoid the tariffs he planned to impose.
But he pulled back on imposing them anyway.
As markets tanked on Monday morning, the potential consequences of a North American trade war were laid bare.
The potential for tariffs to spike the grocery prices that Trump was partly elected to fix came into focus.
There were fresh warnings that the auto industry — a cross-border concern — could seize up and that the price of a new vehicle could soon shoot up by $3,000.
And Canada and Mexico didn't really give up that much.
For the Canadians, the cost of a new border strategy was far lower than the fallout of a trade war — and they'd offered the $1.3 billion border strengthening program back in December.
Adding a new “fentanyl” czar was hardly a huge political loss.
Mexico has several times moved troops to the border.
For example, it sent 10,000 in April 2021 at the request of President Joe Biden, who didn't need to threaten to pitch America's southern neighbor into a recession to get it to act.
Still, Trump has renewed his reputation as a brazen and belligerent force, who sees little distinction between allies and adversaries and leaves his interlocutors guessing at his next move.
This is a good political look back home among some of Trump's supporters.
But he's also reinforced the impression, left over from his first term, that he's merely transactional and cares more about the chance to claim big wins than the substance of his deals.
More seriously, the tariff showdown has confirmed that once again, the foreign policy of the world's most powerful nation is an expression of Trump's volatile character.
And by undermining the US-Mexico-Canada trade deal that he argued in his first term was one of the world's greatest, Trump has undermined trust in America's word and raised doubts over his capacity to close future deals.
Constantly offending the country's closest friends threatens to undermine Western solidarity against America's real enemies like Russian and China.
And by backing down at the 11th hour, the president also sent a clear message to Beijing — which has been slapped with a new 10% tariff on exports to the US — that he might jump at a potential deal if it looks like a breakthrough, even if it lacks depth.
Minutes after those tariffs came in, China retaliated with its own new set of duties which will come into effect on February 10.
Trump has also started to answer one of the key questions about his second term: Is he serious about paying a political price for the disruptive policies he promised would create a new American “golden age?”.
On one hand, the president's vow to rebuild America's manufacturing base, return jobs from low-wage economies overseas and reverse globalization feels like a genuine attempt to help Americans left bereft by the modern economy.
And he's shown more meaningful policy responses to address the terrible toll left by fentanyl and opioid addiction than most other US leaders.
But such an economic transformation achieved with tariffs would come with considerable pain in the short-term.
And his climbdown on Monday suggests he's not really serious.
Trump claims that Canada was failing to crack down on undocumented migration and fentanyl crossing the border.
But federal statistics show that of the 21,889 pounds of fentanyl seized by US border authorities in the 2024 fiscal year, only 43 pounds were taken at the Canadian border .
And of the approximately 1.6 million US Border Patrol encounters with migrants at places other than legal ports of entry, just 23,721, or about 1.5%, were at the northern border.
These inconvenient statistics might explain the scattershot nature of the president's rhetoric on Canada: He's also argued that the tariffs are justified because America's northern neighbor has fallen far short of its NATO obligations to spend 2.0% of GDP on defense. (He's right - official alliance data shows it spent 1.37% on defense in 2024)..
The president also complained that US banks were not able to operate in Canada and that the US didn't need any of its northern neighbor's lumber, oil or products - giving the impression he wants a fight on any grounds.
Former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers told “CNN News Central” that White House claims that Canada was inciting the trade war with the US were “absurd.”.
“Canada is our friend, Canada is not an important source of illegal immigrants, Canada is not an important source of illegal drugs,” said Summers, who served former Democratic President Bill Clinton.
“Canada is an important market for American products, Canada is a crucial co-producer with American automobile companies that enable North America to compete with Asia and Europe,” he said.
The vehemence of Trump's incessant demands for the annexing of Canada caused alarm north of the border.
At first the comments appeared ridiculous, but Trump's consistent harassment of one of America's closest friends is beginning to look like part of a 19th century-style imperialist strategy given his designs on Greenland and the Panama Canal.
“Look, I'd like to see Canada become our 51st state,” Trump said Monday.
“We don't need them for the cars.
We don't need them for lumber.
We don't need them for anything.
” The president added: “As a state, it's different.
As a state, it's much different, and there are no tariffs.”.
Even if the trade war remains suspended in 30 days, the fallout may take years to overcome.
Trump has succeeded in bringing Canadians together at a time of deep political polarization as Trudeau serves out his final months and a general election looms.
Mark Carney, the former governor of the banks of Canada and England and a candidate for the Liberal Party leadership and therefore prime minister, said on “Quest Means Business” on CNN International that Canada was “offended” given its long friendship with the US.
“We are a proud, independent nation.
We view ourselves as the greatest country on Earth.
We have been insulted on multiple occasions by senior members of the administration.
We are not going to reciprocate in those insults.”.
Some Americans in border states with deep ties to Canada are also dismayed.
“The long-term damage to our relations with Canada has really, really been severe.
The feelings of Canadians, our best friend, our best partner, our best allies have been really devastated,” former Michigan Gov.
James Blanchard, a Democrat, told CNN's Phil Mattingly on Monday.
“It's going to take a lot of time, many months, maybe years, to repair the damage to our partnership with our trusted ally, Canada.”.
In a sign of that fury, fans at several NHL and NBA games in Canada have booed the US National Anthem.
It's more normal for Canadian crowds to fill in for anthem singers with microphone issues and belt out the Star-Spangled Banner in a show of affection for their southern neighbors.
Thanks to Trump, the allies are singing a different tune now.

CNN — .
The Grammy Awards are renowned for outlandish fashion.
But on a night of tributes to first responders and victims of LA's recent wildfires, many guests struck a comparatively restrained note at the Crypto.com arena on Sunday.
The all-black trend seen at recent award ceremonies was embraced by everyone from Miley Cyrus (in a cut-out leather Saint Laurent dress) to Olivia Rodrigo (in a slinky halter neck Versace number).
Lady Gaga set a somber tone in a dramatic long-sleeved ball gown by Vivienne Westwood, though some attendees took a more light-hearted approach, whether it was J Balvin's long silk Dior Men coat or the sailor hat Billie Eilish wore with her Prada suit.
Guests also showed their support for LA — which has hosted the Grammys more times than any other city in its 66-year history — by wearing blue heart pins.
Brittany Howard, Jaden Smith and Jacob Collier were among those seen sporting the pins in support of MusiCares, a charity raising money for music industry professionals impacted by the fires.
Elsewhere, several of the evening's most anticipated arrivals used feathers to add volume or definition to their outfits.
Sabrina Carpenter wowed in a custom JW Anderson gown with elegant accents, while the beads and sequins of Cardi B's Roberto Cavalli Couture mermaid gown turned into an autumnal plume as it trailed to the floor.
Meanwhile, Charli XCX and Chappell Roan, who were among the night's most nominated artists, achieved similarly eye-catching effects with ruffles and cascading tulle.
It was perhaps no surprise that both gowns were by the same designer, Jean Paul Gaultier, albeit from very different eras: Charli XCX's outfit was a custom look from the Spring-Summer 2025 runway, while Roan opted for an archive piece from Gaultier's Spring 2003 couture collection.
And this wouldn't be the Grammy's without a bit of skin — or the illusion of it.
The various takes on nude ranged from the subtle (see Madison Beer's divine strapless gown and the sheer detailing of Shakira's Etro dress) to the not-so-subtle.
Ye's wife Bianca Censori left little to the imagination, shocking onlookers by dropping her coat to reveal a see-through slip dress that was, in every sense, barely there.
See below for some of the event's best and boldest looks.
This story will be updated throughout the evening.

Our seven-part guide will help you ease into a healthy routine, backed by experts . .
CNN — .
I confess that like a lot of people, I am guilty of not getting in my steps.
After hours at my desk, the thought of changing, driving to the gym and working out is so exhausting that I end up back on my couch binge-watching the latest shows.
Studies show that 10,000 steps is an arbitrary number — taking as few as 2,517 steps daily was associated with lower mortality rates — but everyone benefits from moving around more.
Getting enough movement is a growing issue among Americans.
One in 4 adults sit for more than eight hours daily, and nearly half of this group does not exercise.
TikTok's latest fitness trend, the mini stepper, is motivating people like me to get off the couch and move.
Fitness influencers are peddling the low-impact cardio workout as an alternative to the gym.
“The mini stepper is so trendy because it's a way for people to get movement in without needing to go outside,” said Tami Smith, a personal trainer and founder of Fit Healthy Macros in Florida.
“You can hop on a mini stepper and watch TV, killing two birds with one stone.”.
Looking to add more daily movement?
Fitness experts agree that the mini stepper is an affordable option — most models range between $30 and $100 and come equipped with resistance bands.
With add-ons such as handlebars and nonslip grip mats for greater stability, this easy-to-use device can add variety to any fitness routine.
Mini steppers use two pedals to move up and down in a continuous motion that resembles climbing a flight of stairs.
“It's a hybrid between a stair stepper and an elliptical because it has an elliptical-type gliding motion, but in miniature form,” Smith said.
“The compact size makes it an affordable option without taking up too much space in the house.”.
This gym apparatus primarily targets the lower body along with core muscles, maintaining an upright position while in motion.
Tom Hendrickx, a physical therapist and owner of Pivot Physical Therapy in California, said swinging the arms creates a natural walking or running gait that works out the upper body.
Most mini steppers also include resistance bands that allow people to activate more of their upper body muscles through bicep curls, arm presses and lateral raises.
Along with getting people to move more, Hendrickx said the mini stepper helps cardiovascular health by increasing users' heart rates.
Elevated heart rates strengthen the heart muscle to work harder, pumping blood more efficiently and improving circulation.
He added that it also strengthens bones because it is a weight-bearing exercise — joints and muscles support body weight to remain upright against gravity.
As for weight loss, Smith said the mini stepper helps burn calories and can catalyze a weight loss journey for a sedentary person.
However, she warned that shedding pounds depends on how often people exercise and whether they follow a diet with a calorie deficit (eating less calories than you're burning). .
Users also may experience mental health benefits.
A quick session on the mini stepper can instantly boost mood and energy levels and help with a better night's sleep, Smith said.
Working out will also increase self-esteem.
“Going from sedentary to moving on the mini stepper will help with a positive self-image as you know that you're making steps toward improving your health,” she said.
As with any exercise machine, the mini stepper has some drawbacks.
First, the machine requires people to maintain an upright standing position in which they step their feet up and down.
With no railings, sustaining this position can be difficult for those with balance issues.
“For an older adult or someone with coordination issues, a mini stepper is probably not the best tool,” Smith said.
“I would rather see these people on an exercise machine where they have the stability of handlebars or something that they could easily grab to ensure they don't have a misstep and end up getting hurt.”.
By design, mini steppers have a short stroke cycle, offering a smaller range of motion than a full-size stair climber.
And while a mini stepper increases a person's daily step count, Hendrickx said those steps may not reflect accurately on a pedometer or an activity tracker.
Third, the mini stepper is excellent for strengthening leg muscles but doesn't do as much for glutes, Hendrickx said, noting that full glute activation requires the hip joint to be flexed at a 90-degree angle, similar to sitting down on a chair.
Working on a mini stepper provides little squats, with the hips bending at a 15- to 30-degree angle.
“Unless you're raising your leg up pretty high, so your thigh is parallel to the floor and pushing all the way back down, you're not maximizing the activation of the glutes,” he added.
If the goal is to get up and move, Smith and Hendrickx fully support investing in a mini stepper.
“Any movement is better than no movement,” Smith added.
Hendrickx recommended using it twice weekly for 10 minutes for someone just starting to engage in physical activity.
After several weeks, he said people should challenge themselves to work out three times a week for 15 minutes each session.
Eventually, the goal would be to use the mini stepper for 20 to 30 minutes a day.

Title: Education Department employees placed on paid leave as part of Trump administration's DEI purge | CNN Politics
# Education Department employees placed on paid leave as part of Trump administration's DEI purge | CNN Politics.
CNN — .
Dozens of employees at the Education Department were placed on paid administrative leave Friday as part of the Trump administration's larger effort to rid the federal workforce of employees associated with diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility efforts, two sources familiar with the move told CNN.
The department sent letters to employees informing them that their email accounts were being suspended but that they would continue to receive paychecks for an indefinite period, the sources said.
The department cited guidance from the White House's Office of Personnel and Management, issued on January 21, that directed government agencies to notify “all employees of DEIA offices that they are being placed on paid administrative leave effective immediately as the agency takes steps to close/end all DEIA initiatives, offices and programs.” .
The agency is the latest to face upheaval amid the White House's efforts to weed out DEI programs within the government and reshape the federal workforce in President Donald Trump's image.
In a statement to CNN on Monday, Madi Biedermann, an Education Department spokesperson, said the agency is “evaluating staffing in line with the commitment to prioritizing meaningful learning ahead of divisive ideology in schools and putting student outcomes above special interests.”.
At least 55 Education Department employees, including senior-level career workers who have served at the agency for decades, were notified Friday night that they'd been placed on paid leave, according to the American Federation of Government Employees, the union representing the agency's career officials.
“Effective January 31, 2025, you will be placed on administrative leave with full pay and benefits pursuant to the President's executive order on DEIA and further guidance from OPM,” the letter says, according to a copy obtained by CNN.
“This administrative leave is not being done for any disciplinary purpose.”.
According to the union, these employees do not hold job titles nor official duties related to DEIA, but they included staffers such as civil rights attorneys who handle student discrimination and antisemitism complaints; an employee working in a grant office; and a member of the artificial intelligence team helping the department understand AI in education.
But Sheria Smith, union president for Department of Education career employees, told CNN the employees placed on paid leave had attended a two-day diversity training seminar in 2019 during the first Trump administration “that was required for senior-level employees and strongly encouraged for others,” as well as similar training under the Biden administration.
Others affected had either participated in a one-day lunch training on DEI or had volunteered with an agency group or committee that plans programs such as Black History Month celebrations.
The diversity training for Education Department employees was encouraged during the first Trump administration under then-Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, whose goal was for 400 employees to attend the sessions, according to the union.
Because of the large participation in the 2019 training seminar, the union is worried that hundreds more Department of Education staffers could be affected.
“We've filed several requests for information with the agency to get a clear understanding of what's happening and how many employees overall will be impacted,” Smith told CNN, but the union has not received any additional information.
The New York Times first reported on the letters sent to Education Department employees informing them that they were being put on paid administrative leave.
The White House last month ordered government DEI employees to be placed on administrative leave and ended the use of DEI in hiring and federal contracting.
“The mission of the agency is stalled because this administration has forced these people to stop performing work for the American people,” Smith told CNN.
Agency leaders were also instructed to ask employees to report any efforts to “disguise these programs” in federal jobs and contract descriptions since the November election.

CNN — .
Like most of us, Earth has a lot going on under the surface — even in what may have once seemed to be its most unassuming layer.
The mantle, a zone between our planet's thin crust and the molten core, features 1,800 miles (2,900 kilometers) of mostly solid rock, with a consistency like thickened caramel that scientists long hypothesized was uniformly blended.
But massive unmixed regions have been found lingering in the mantle, like lumps of chocolate in a cookie, and new findings are just beginning to reveal their secrets.
Among the enigmatic mantle lumps are two enormous “supercontinents” buried thousands of kilometers below the crust amid the remains of ancient tectonic plates.
One supercontinent lies under Africa, and the other resides deep under the Pacific Ocean.
Using a new method to analyze data from earthquakes, researchers recently uncovered previously unknown details about these vast island regions, revealing that they may serve as anchors in our planet's mantle and that they could be much older than previously thought.
The discovery adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that the rocky mantle isn't as well-stirred by Earth's internal churning as once believed.
And hidden structures or pockets of unblended material, such as these supercontinents, may shape mantle activity, including plate movement, in ways that are yet to be understood, scientists reported January 22 in the journal Nature .
“These findings will contribute to a better understanding of mantle convection and plate tectonics, and, therefore, phenomena we experience at the surface like earthquakes and volcanism,” said Claire Richardson , a doctoral candidate in the School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University, who was not involved in the new research.
“Resolving the physical, thermal, and chemical properties of rocks ~3000 km (1,864 miles) below our feet, at extreme temperatures and pressures, is a challenging problem to say the least,” Richardson told CNN in an email.
“Open questions abound, and each new study gets us closer to understanding what's really going on down there.”.
Researchers first spotted the subterranean supercontinents about 50 years ago when they popped up as anomalies in seismic data generated by earthquakes powerful enough to send reverberations through the planet.
When seismic waves encounter unusual structures in the mantle, changes in wave speed provide seismologists with clues about Earth's deep interior.
Over the decades, seismic data revealed that these supercontinents make up about 20% of the mantle-core boundary.
Each of the buried islands covers hundreds of thousands of miles, and in some spots they tower nearly 600 miles (965 kilometers) tall.
However, little was known about what they were made of, when they sank and what role they might play in mantle flow, known as convection, said Dr. Sujania Talavera-Soza , lead author of the new study and a geosciences and seismology researcher at Utrecht University in the Netherlands.
“Their origin and whether they are long-lived structures — it's widely debated,” Talavera-Soza said.
Earlier research focused on the velocity of seismic waves, showing that wave speed slowed by about 2% upon arriving at the supercontinents.
This slowing of seismic waves led geologists to name the regions large low shear velocity provinces, or LLSVPs.
Velocity loss in seismic waves suggested that these mantle zones were hotter than the rocks around them, Talavera-Soza said.
But it was unknown whether the LLSVPs differed structurally from nearby regions.
Scientists were also uncertain whether the supercontinents were actively involved in convection, or if they were “kind of dense piles that would just be sitting there,” said study coauthor Dr. Arwen Deuss , a professor of structure and composition of Earth's deep interior at Utrecht University.
“There was no information about that,” Deuss said.
“We only knew that seismic waves slowed down.”.
In the new study, the authors used a different approach for studying the LLSVPs to see if they could tease out details about the zones' composition and activity.
They looked at the attenuation, or intensity, of seismic signals as they traveled through the mantle to see how much energy the vibrations from quakes lost.
In music, attenuation is comparable to damping a tone, which produces a lower volume, Deuss said.
Examining the attenuation of the waves — along with changes in wave speed — could provide previously unseen clues about LLSVPs' makeup.
The best data for this is from waves produced by earthquakes that are magnitude 7.8 or higher, Talavera-Soza added.
Wave speed and energy loss were known to be affected by mineral grain size as well as temperature, so the authors used a physics model that linked seismology and mineral physics.
Waves are damped more when they encounter material made of smaller grains; if lots of grains are packed together, there are more boundaries between the grains that can sap a wave's energy.
Other studies revealed that the supercontinents had company in the deep mantle.
Around them were “ slab graveyards ” of sunken tectonic plates, Deuss said.
They were cooler than the LLSVPs, so seismic waves moved through them more quickly.
However, the new model showed that while seismic waves' velocity dipped when they reached LLSVPs, the waves didn't lose much energy.
By comparison, there was significant damping among the cooler graveyards around the LLSVPs.
Researchers believe those differences come down to the comparative ages of the structures.
Over millions of years, as rocky material descends through the boundary between the upper and lower mantle, mineral crystals are compressed and reformed into tinier grains that then regrow over time.
Younger regions therefore have smaller crystals, which suck more energy from seismic waves, so the amount of damping in a region hints at how old it is.
“The fact that the LLSVPs show very little damping, means that they must consist of much larger grains than their surroundings,” Talavera-Soza said.
Larger mineral grains suggested that the supercontinents were significantly older than the tectonic graveyards around them, as their grains must have had more time to grow, according to the study.
Larger building blocks would also make the supercontinents more rigid, keeping them separate from mantle convection, or movement of materials in that layer due to heat transfer.
“Our study points to the LLSVPs being long-lived features, at least half a billion years old, perhaps even older,” Talavera-Soza said.
“This implies they act as anchors at the base of the core-mantle boundary and have survived mantle convection, meaning that the mantle is not well-mixed.”.
This discovery follows another recent revelation about even more “sunken worlds” that contradict the notion of a blended mantle.
Buried plates in tectonic graveyards tend to accumulate in alignment with Earth's subduction zones — regions where the edges of two plates meet, and where one slides beneath the other.
But earlier this year, another team of scientists identified sunken tectonic slabs far from these boundaries in locations under continents' interiors and beneath oceans, where sunken plates had never been found before.
“Apparently, such zones in the Earth's mantle are much more widespread than previously thought,” said Thomas Schouten , lead author of that investigation and a researcher at the Geological Institute of ETH Zurich, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, in a statement .
The model in the new study — the first 3D attenuation model for the entire mantle — will help seismologists to better understand what lies thousands of kilometers below Earth's surface, said Richardson, the doctoral candidate.
“It maps regions of the Earth that weaken seismic energy, ultimately affecting the measurements many seismologists use to understand other physical and chemical properties of Earth's interior,” she said.
The findings could transform researchers' understanding of plate tectonics and how plate movement might be shaped by these ancient, fixed anchors near Earth's core, Deuss said.
Further analysis of the supercontinents could also reveal if they are the source of geochemical elements nearly as old as Earth itself that are found in lava from certain types of volcanoes, she added.
“These LLSVPs have been there for a long time — if they've been there for a billion years, they might have also been there for 4 billion years.
They might well be that hidden reservoir where these chemical primordial elements might be located.
We can't prove that now, but geochemists can investigate this,” Deuss said.
“From this study, I think there will be a lot of extra research that might answer a lot of outstanding questions that have been confusing scientists for ages.”.

Title: Chuck Todd is leaving NBC | CNN Business
# Chuck Todd is leaving NBC | CNN Business.
CNN — .
Chuck Todd, former moderator of NBC's “Meet the Press,” is leaving the network after nearly 20 years.
In an internal memo on Friday, Todd thanked his longtime colleagues and said he has a “few new projects” in the works, signaling a desire for a more entrepreneurial phase of his career.
For that reason, he said he is leaving the network a number of months before his NBC contract was set to expire.
Todd said NBC is allowing him to take his twice-a-week podcast franchise, “The ChuckToddcast,” to a new distributor.
For about a decade, Todd was one of the most prominent voices at NBC News, covering the political rise of Donald Trump and the Democratic response.
He helmed “Meet the Press” from 2014 until 2023.
Todd was outspoken about the corrosive impacts of Trump-era lies and indecency — and was ridiculed by Trump and others for it.
In 2023, after a management change atop NBC News, Todd stepped down from “Meet the Press” and Kristen Welker took over his role.
Todd said it was important not to “overstay” his welcome — a striking message for a Washington crowd full of elderly politicos.
“I'd rather leave a little bit too soon than stay a tad too long,” he added.
Todd saw his air time diminished in recent years, though he remained a prominent part of political and Election Night coverage last November.
In a statement on Friday NBC News said, “We're grateful for Chuck's many contributions to our political coverage during his nearly two-decade career at NBC News and for his deep commitment to 'Meet the Press' and its enduring legacy.
We wish him all the best in his next endeavors.”.
In his memo, Todd said, “The media has a lot of work to do to win back the trust of viewers/listeners/readers and I'm convinced the best place to start is from the bottom up,” with local instead of national media.
“This is a ripe moment,” he added.
“The only way to fix this information ecosystem is to stop whining about the various ways the social media companies are manipulating things and instead roll up our collective sleeves and start with local.”.

Title: Trump said he hadn't read Project 2025 - but most of his early executive orders overlap with its proposals | CNN Politics
# Trump said he hadn't read Project 2025 - but most of his early executive orders overlap with its proposals | CNN Politics.
CNN — .
President Donald Trump caught his own administration off guard last week by suggesting that the nation's primary disaster response agency might simply “go away.” .
Though Trump had routinely lambasted the Federal Emergency Management Agency throughout his third White House bid, he had stopped short of calling for its elimination.
Now, an executive order bearing his signature has put that possibility in motion.
The idea, however, wasn't new.
The contours of it circulated nearly two years ago through Project 2025, a sweeping plan to overhaul the government that Trump as a candidate forcefully disavowed.
Many of Trump's early actions appear closely aligned with Project 2025's plans.
A CNN analysis of the 53 executive orders and actions from Trump's first week in office found that more than two-thirds - 36 - evoke proposals outlined in “Mandate for Leadership,” Project 2025's 922-page blueprint for the next Republican president.
The overlap includes early steps taken by Trump to execute some of his most-touted pledges: cracking down on illegal immigration; dismantling diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives; and rolling back environmental restrictions on oil and gas exploration.
But the framework offered in “Mandate for Leadership” also foreshadowed some of Trump's more provocative and less expected early actions.
It calls for “quickly and aggressively” punishing countries that refuse deported migrants - as Trump did Sunday when Colombia blocked two US military planes carrying deportees.
It advises the president to “immediately revoke the security clearance” of top national security officials accused by conservatives of political bias, a move Trump executed within hours of taking office.
And Trump's directive to curb foreign aid from countries “not fully aligned” with his global aims appeases Project 2025's concern that these programs are “disconnected from the strategy and practice of U.S. foreign policy.”.
“This is exactly the work we set out to do,” Paul Dans, who oversaw Project 2025 at the conservative Heritage Foundation, told CNN in an interview Wednesday.
“It's still in the early first stages of bearing fruit, but we wanted to make sure the president was ready to hit the ground running on day one.
The rapidity and the depth of what they've rolled out this quickly is a testament to the work done in Project 2025 and other presidential transition projects.”.
The fraction of executive actions that so far do not touch on Project 2025 priorities include some of Trump's narrower fixations, like declassifying records on the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, requiring federal workers to return to the office and demanding the flag fly at full staff during presidential inaugurations.
In a statement to CNN, the White House picked up where Trump's campaign left off downplaying any connection between the Republican leader and the conservative playbook.
The president, his spokesman Harrison Fields said, “had nothing to do with Project 2025.” .
“In his first few days in office, President Trump has delivered on the promises that earned him a resounding mandate from the American people - securing the border, restoring common sense, driving down inflation, and unleashing American energy,” Fields said.
The Heritage Foundation declined to comment. .
Think tanks and advocacy organizations from both sides of the aisle typically prepare for incoming administrations with ready-made policy proposals.
But Project 2025 was significant for its breadth and coordination across the conservative movement.
The Heritage Foundation has found success influencing Republican administrations “through the back channels where a lot of Washington work happens” going back to President Ronald Reagan, said Heath Brown, a City University of New York professor who's written multiple books on presidential transitions.
The organization once boasted that Trump during his first year as president had implemented 64 percent of the 334 policies recommended in the 2016 version of “Mandate for Leadership.”
As Trump prepared for a third White House bid, he set the stage for Heritage's seminal work to inform his next administration's priorities once again.
“They're going to lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do,” Trump said during an April 2022 keynote address to the organization first unearthed by the Washington Pos t.
At least 140 former Trump administration officials and dozens of ardent allies ultimately wrote and contributed to “Mandate for Leadership.”
More than 100 friendly organizations endorsed it.
But by mid-2024, with Democrats seizing on Project 2025's more controversial proposals, Trump furiously sought to distance himself from what would become a deeply unpopular manifesto.
“I have nothing to do with Project 2025,” Trump said in the opening moments of his September debate against Vice President Kamala Harris.
“That's out there.
I haven't read it.
I don't want to read it, purposely.
I'm not going to read it.”.
Since his November victory, though, Trump has filled key government posts with people who helped put Project 2025 together.
Both Tom Homan, who is serving as White House border czar, and Trump's new CIA Director John Ratcliffe contributed to “Mandate for Leadership.”
Brendan Carr, named chairman of the Federal Communications Commission by Trump, wrote an entire chapter for Project 2025 on the agency he now leads.
Russ Vought, chosen as director of the Office of Management and Budget, authored a section on presidential power that appeared to preview the freeze on federal spending put in place this week by Trump's young government.
The president, Vought wrote for Project 2025, “should use every possible tool to propose and impose fiscal discipline on the federal government.
Anything short of that would constitute abject failure.”.
Dans, who stepped down from his position in July amid intensifying criticism of Project 2025 from Trump, said the first week of Trump's new term has been “gratifying” to watch.
He called the Democratic Party's “obsession” with Project 2025 - the subject of tens of millions of dollars in negative ads during the presidential race - an “epic electoral fail.”.
Democrats, though, continue to attack Trump over his ties to the conservative blueprint.
Since the election, the Democratic National Committee has sent more than 50 press releases that included the term “Project 2025.”.
Some of the synergy between Trump's early movements and Project 2025 reflect the expected harmony of a new Republican administration and a supportive right-wing group.
Indeed, a considerable share of the manifesto's voluminous policy plans are anchored in two consistent themes: unravel Joe Biden's presidency wherever possible and return to the policies of Trump's first term.
In Trump's first executive order after taking office, he revoked 67 of Biden's executive orders - including at least 15 singled out in “Mandate for Leadership.”.
Meanwhile, reinstating his first-term border policies - such as blocking federal grants to cities that don't comply with immigration enforcement - satisfied some of Project 2025's own immigration prescriptions.
But Trump also moved to restrict temporary protected status for those fleeing humanitarian emergencies, paused disbursements to non-profits assisting undocumented immigrants and mobilized the military to assist in border enforcement - all policies pushed by Project 2025.
“This is not a continuation of the first Trump administration.
It is substantially more aggressive, and he's doing a lot of the things we complained he didn't do in the first term,” said Ken Cuccinelli, the acting deputy secretary for the Department of Homeland Security under Trump who authored the Project 2025 section on his former agency.
The “general aggressiveness is certainly consistent” with what Cuccinelli wrote in Project 2025, he added, pointing especially to the deployment of the military and Trump's use of Department of Justice officers to assist in deportation.
As for FEMA, Cuccinelli in “Mandate for Leadership” urged the new administration to “shift the majority of preparedness and response costs to states and localities.”
The language is recognizable in the proposal Trump floated recently while touring North Carolina flood damage: “We're going to recommend that FEMA go away and we pay directly, we pay a percentage, to the state, and the state should fix it.”.
In his ensuing executive order, Trump launched a commission to review changes to FEMA, including whether the agency should be reformed to function only as a “support agency” to the states.
Michael Coen, a former FEMA chief of staff during the Obama and Biden administrations, said that while he had seen the Project 2025 proposal for the agency, it surprised him to hear Trump vocalize it.
“I never imagined it would be something that he would openly talk about,” Coen said.
“It does seem like there are people in the president's ear that are pushing what is in Project 2025 as far as their plan for FEMA.”.
Cuccinelli acknowledged he also hadn't expected Trump to embrace his proposal on FEMA.
In his first term, Trump relished his power awarding emergency relief to disaster-stricken areas.
“President Trump does love to show up and write checks, but I give him a lot of credit,” Cuccinelli said.
“He clearly recognizes that FEMA as a concept is failing.”.
Coen expects Republican governors and local officials will push back against this worldview.
“States across the country have come to rely on the federal government,” Coen said.
“It's hard to budget for if you're going to get a 500-year rain event that's going to wash away a town, and wash away your critical infrastructure.”.
Trump previewed many of his opening movements as president more than a year ago in a series of policy proposals published on a campaign website called “Agenda47,” such as ending subsidies for electric vehicles, limiting refugee programs and restoring a first-term directive allowing him to remove federal workers deemed insufficiently loyal.
Those ideas were separately backed by Project 2025's authors.
Trump's campaign website made clear he intended to reopen Alaska to drilling - which he did on his first day as president.
Project 2025 endorsed not only the move, but also the urgency.
“Alaska is a special case and deserves immediate action,” one section said.
Some of Project 2025's other priorities have been achieved indirectly through Trump's actions.
For example, a pending plan by the Biden administration for a ground and surface water limit on toxic PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, was withdrawn under Trump's day one freeze on new regulations.
A section on the Environmental Protection Agency in “Mandate for Leadership” encouraged the new president to “revisit the designation of PFAS chemicals as 'hazardous substances.'”.
Groups that had pushed for the Biden administration to crack down on PFAS - known as “forever chemicals” because they don't degrade in the environment - were well aware of the target placed on those regulations by Project 2025, said Melanie Benesh, vice president of governmental affairs at the Environmental Working Group.
There was some reason for optimism, Benesh acknowledged, when Lee Zeldin, Trump's EPA administrator, touted his past work tackling PFAS during his confirmation hearing.
But that hope dissipated when Trump's executive order effectively stalled Biden's planned crackdown.
“It calls into question the incoming administrator's commitment to taking on PFAS,” Benesh told CNN.
EPA spokeswoman Molly Vaseliou said it was “common transition procedure” to hold pending regulations when a new administration comes in.
“President Trump advanced conservation and environmental stewardship while promoting economic growth for families across the country in his first term and will continue to do so this term,” Vaseliou said.
As the administration moves forward, the extent to which Trump's actions run parallel to Project 2025 will remain a central question.
Some of Trump's early executive orders appear to lay the groundwork for future actions advocated by Project 2025.
For example, Trump's national energy emergency calls for a review of regulations protecting endangered and marine wildlife that may be “obstacles to domestic energy infrastructure.”
Project 2025 suggests the new administration move immediately to lift protections on grizzly bears and gray wolves and work with Congress on an overhaul of the Endangered Species Act.
Elsewhere, Trump has taken steps that seem to go beyond what Project 2025 has proposed.
Nowhere in the dozens of pages dedicated to a forceful crackdown on immigration do “Mandate for Leadership” authors suggest declaring the US is under invasion and designating Mexican drug cartels as terrorist groups, as Trump did in his executive orders.
Similarly, Trump exceeded Project 2025's calls to restart federal executions with an executive order expanding the potential crimes that could trigger the death penalty.
Still, not all of Project 2025's plans are necessarily included in the public manifesto.
The project's website acknowledged it intended to deliver the Trump transition a “playbook of actions” for the administration's first 180 days.
Neither Heritage nor the Trump White House would say if that exchange took place.
And in a hidden-camera video of Vought released last year , he said his group was drafting hundreds of potential orders, regulations and memos for Trump.
“With immigration in particular, executive orders aren't necessarily the thing that makes policy change,” said Dara Lind, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, an advocacy group for immigrants.
“What's been notable from the first nine days or so is not just that they had the executive orders ready to go on day one,” but other technical regulations and declarations on hand as well.
“That kind of timeline indicates a certain amount of preparation before getting into office,” she said.
Dans noted Project 2025 also engaged in a nationwide search for Trump loyalists to fill federal agencies with people who would execute his agenda.
“It all comes down to implementation,” Dans said, “And Project 2025 was ultimately about putting in place the people who would come in from outside the swamp and make changes.”.
On at least one issue, Trump is already spurning Project 2025: the future of TikTok.
Trump in an executive order paused a ban on the Chinese social media app, which Project 2025 described as a national security imperative.
Trump also recently said he was “ very unlikely ” to limit abortion pill access.
Project 2025 not only pushes for the administration to reverse federal approval of the abortion pill mifepristone, it also proposes excluding the morning-after pill and men's contraceptives from coverage mandated under the Affordable Care Act.
Trump has, though, moved to restrict federal funding for abortions both domestically and abroad, a stance that also appears in Project 2025's policy framework.
And his nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., told a Senate hearing Wednesday that Trump asked him to “study the safety” of mifepristone.
CNN's review of Trump's executive actions covered the first week of his new term, from his swearing in until noon on Monday.
In the days since, he has remained active, restricting certain treatments for transgender minors, keeping transgender adults out of the military and reinstating servicemembers who were discharged for refusing COVID vaccinations.
Each of those moves had support in Project 2025.

Title: Tech giants ramp up the battle against online hate speech in Europe.
At home, some are pulling back | CNN Business
# Tech giants ramp up the battle against online hate speech in Europe.
At home, some are pulling back | CNN Business.
New York CNN — .
Two of America's Big Tech companies are opening the door to more “free expression,” even if it means more hateful content.
But in Europe, Big Tech companies are voluntarily cracking down.
It's a reminder of just how divergent Europeans' and Americans' online experiences are becoming, as EU lawmakers forge ahead with tech safety and accountability legislation against an industry widely seen as too big and too out of control, while such proposals have languished, if not faced active resistance, on Capitol Hill.
Tech platforms including Meta's Facebook and Instagram, X, Snapchat, TikTok, Twitch, LinkedIn and YouTube this week signed onto an updated European Union code of conduct promising to do more to combat online hate speech, which is often illegal in European countries.
Meanwhile, two of those same platforms — Meta and X — have made changes in the United States that they acknowledge could usher in more hateful speech, arguing that such changes promote freedom of speech and combat censorship.
And across the industry, companies have shrunk teams whose entire job was to ensure the safety of their platforms, including from people who seek to foment hate and violence.
The contrast is striking.
As part of the EU agreement, the companies agree to allow “monitoring reporters” — non-profits or public organizations with expertise on hate speech — to review their platforms and to act quickly on most of the content they flag, the European Commission said Monday.
The new code of conduct is voluntary, but tech companies can use their compliance to demonstrate that they are meeting obligations legally required by the EU's Digital Services Act (DSA) , which, among other things, mandates Big Tech platforms take meaningful steps to reduce illegal and harmful content.
“In Europe there is no place for illegal hate, either offline or online,” Henna Virkkunen, the commission's executive vice president for tech sovereignty, security and democracy, said in a statement, adding that the commitments will help “ensure a safe digital space for all.”.
It's one of a number of differences in US versus EU tech users' online experiences that have accumulated over time, Isabelle Wright, director of technology and society at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, told CNN.
“I think we've been heading in this direction for a while, but not just for hate speech, I think really for all categories of harm that most (other) Western nations cover in in their tech regulation,” Wright said.
“It's going to lead to an incredibly fractured information ecosystem between the US and essentially every other Western democracy.”.
Meta and X did not respond to requests for comment.
To be sure, Silicon Valley's efforts have always been far from perfect.
Meta's platforms have been accused of playing a key role in the organization of the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol and abetting genocide in Myanmar.
And across the tech world, efforts to address harmful content like hate speech have always been targeted, at least to some extent, at placating advertisers obsessed with “brand safety,” terrified at the thought that their ads could be placed next to a comment section awash in inflammatory remarks and threats of violence.
With advertising being the prime revenue generator for social media companies, the tastes of advertisers has historically set the tone.
But now even those efforts have been scaled back in the United States.
Elon Musk-owned X has seen an uptick in hate speech in recent years as it welcomed previously banned White supremacists and conspiracy peddlers back to the platform.
Musk himself has also boosted racist conspiracies on the site.
And Meta earlier this month announced several major content moderation policy changes in the United States, including scaling back its automated systems for removing content that violates its policies.
The systems will now be focused on checking only for illegal and “high-severity” violations such as terrorism and child sexual exploitation.
Meta also updated its hateful conduct policy to roll back protections for certain groups, including women and LGBTQ+ people.
Users of Meta's platforms will now, for example, be able to refer to women as household objects and suggest that transgender people are mentally ill, without fear that their comments will be removed or restricted by Facebook's moderation team. (A Meta spokesperson noted that the company would continue to prohibit slurs, as well as attacks against certain groups, such as those based on ethnicity, race and religion.).
Terms of Service with Clare Duffy How Do You Fact-Check Social Media?
Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg says the company is ending its partnership with third-party fact-checkers in the US because the program caused too much censorship on the company's platforms.
The announcement raised a big question: How much were third-party fact-checkers really responsible for what content stays or goes on Meta's platforms?
Carlos Hernández-Echevarría, head of public policy at fact checking organization Maldita.es, explains how the group fact-checks posts - and what happens to that content after they do.

The platforms' US moves may reflect the changing American political environment, where many Republican leaders have equated content moderation with “censorship.” .
Members of the incoming Donald Trump administration, including the nominee to lead the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr, have also called for a reinterpretation of the tech immunity law Section 230.
In essence, they want tech companies to be protected from lawsuits over what their users post only if they do little-to-no content moderation whatsoever.
Following Meta's announcement earlier this month, Carr posted a gif of Jack Nicholson grinning and nodding in response to CNN's Brian Stelter post on X with the news about the tech giant's moderation policy.
When tech platforms announce changing policies or principles, Wright said, “the language they use to stand behind those indicates that they've put in, you know, a lot of a lot of thought and consultation into these processes.
Yet when an administration changes, those principles seem to change like the wind in order to better align with the people who could potentially regulate them or disrupt their businesses.”.
“I think what has become clear to the platforms is that the chances of any type of tech regulation in the US are slim to none,” Wright said.
But it isn't just hate speech where Americans have a different experience.
Europeans are protected in much broader ways, too.
Unlike Americans, Europeans are protected from having their personal demographic information, such as their race and political views, collected by tech companies without their consent, thanks to the General Data Protection Regulation .
Nor can Big Tech firms stop app developers from communicating cheaper, off-platform offers to users because of the Digital Markets Act .
The DSA also provides EU users with greater protections from targeted online ads.
And Europeans may have less access to AI tools, including products from Apple and Meta , because of privacy regulations and an EU law aimed at safe and responsible development of the technology.
But that divergence has the potential to become less pronounced as tech leaders have cozied up to Trump in the hopes that the new administration will advance their interests.
Zuckerberg and Musk, as well as Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and TikTok CEO Shou Chew, were all seated prominently at Trump's inauguration Monday.
Some of those Big Tech CEOs have already suggested they want Trump to pressure Europe into relaxing protections and regulations on the continent.
Cook is said to have raised the issue of European regulations in a meeting with Trump at Mar-a-Lago following the election.
And Zuckerberg has expressly said he will seek Trump's help in pushing back on safety rules from the EU and elsewhere.
In his policy announcement earlier this month, Zuckerberg said: “We're going to work with President Trump to push back on governments around the world that are going after American companies and pushing to censor more.”.

Title: Trump fires head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau | CNN Business
# Trump fires head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau | CNN Business.
New York CNN — .
President Donald Trump has fired Rohit Chopra, the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
Chopra received an email from the White House on Saturday morning informing him of the firing, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.
Chopra, who has been targeted by Republican lawmakers for putting restrictions on financial institutions in favor of consumers, announced his departure in a post on X on Saturday.
“This letter confirms that my term as CFPB Director has concluded.
I know the CFPB is ready to work with you and the next confirmed Director, and we have a great deal of energy to ensure continued success,” Chopra wrote .
The CFPB declined to comment on the news.
“It's the executive's decision and prerogative to see who they want in that role,” a White House official told CNN.
Major consumer banks including Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase are among companies facing lawsuits from the CFPB.
They, alongside tech industry leaders, have encouraged Trump to remove Chopra from his role — which was made possible by a 2020 Supreme Court ruling that enabled presidents to fire CFPB directors.
Chopra was appointed in 2021 by former President Joe Biden to serve as director of the bureau that regulates financial agencies.
The director of the CFPB, who under law was to serve a five-year term, also serves as a board member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, voting on key banking regulations.
Chopra will no longer be serving in that role either.
In his time at the CFPB, Chopra spearheaded controversial regulation limiting overdraft fees banks can charge as well as late fees credit card companies could collect from customers.
The rule intending to cap credit card late fees at $8 was later struck down by a federal judge.
The CFPB rule on overdraft fees, which would cap them at $5 — a substantial savings from the $35 that customers are typically charged — was finalized at the end of last year but is likely to face legal challenges , as well.
Under Chopra's leadership, the CFPB also finalized a rule making personal data more accessible so that it is easier to switch banks.
Before Trump took office this month, the agency finalized a rule that would remove about $49 billion in medical bills from credit reports.
“People who get sick shouldn't have their financial future upended,” said Chopra in a statement on January 7.
The consumer watchdog agency was created after the 2008 financial crisis by way of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.
The agency was the brainchild of Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who began advocating for it in 2007 when she was a Harvard Law School professor.
Warren, the ranking member of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, applauded Chopra for “holding Wall Street accountable for cheating hard-working families,” she said Saturday in a statement.
Despite their differences with Trump, Warren and several progressive lawmakers, including Sen. Bernie Sanders, have signaled their support for the president's campaign promise to temporarily cap credit interest rates at 10% — less than half of current rates according to Federal Reserve data.
To fulfill this promise, Warren said Trump “needs a strong CFPB and a strong CFPB director,” adding that “if President Trump and Republicans decide to cower to Wall Street billionaires and destroy the agency, they will have a fight on their hands.”.

Title: China hits back at US with import tariffs including on crude oil, as Trump's measures go into effect | CNN Business
# China hits back at US with import tariffs including on crude oil, as Trump's measures go into effect | CNN Business.
Hong Kong CNN — .
Beijing announced a broad package of economic measures targeting the United States on Tuesday, hitting back after US President Donald Trump imposed 10% tariffs on Chinese imports.
The fresh duties, announced by China's Ministry of Finance, levy a 15% tax on certain types of coal and liquefied natural gas and a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery, large-displacement cars and pickup trucks.
The measures take effect on February 10.
The Ministry of Commerce and China's customs administration also announced new export controls effective immediately on more than two dozen metal products and related technologies.
Those include tungsten, a critical mineral typically used in industrial and defense applications, as well as tellurium, which can be used to make solar cells.
The ministry also said it was adding two American firms — biotech company Illumina and fashion retailer PVH Group , owner of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger — to its unreliable entities list, saying they “violated normal market trading principles.” .
In a separate statement , China's State Administration for Market Regulation said it was initiating an investigation into Google for suspected violation of its anti-monopoly.
The company, whose search engine is not available in China, has minimal operations in the country.
The raft of announcements come as a broad-based 10% tariff on Chinese imports to the United States announced by the White House on Saturday came into effect.
China's measures appear to vary in their potential impact on the US economy and businesses.
For example, China is the leading global producer of tungsten concentrates, representing more than 80% of world production, according to US government estimates from 2020.
The tariffed items, however, represent a relatively small proportion of overall bilateral trade.
“The measures are fairly modest, at least relative to US moves, and have clearly been calibrated to try to send a message to the US (and domestic audiences) without inflicting too much damage,” Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China Economics at financial insight firm Capital Economics, said in a research note Tuesday.
The Chinese tariffs target at most $20 billion of the country's annual imports from the US, about 12% of the total, which is “a far cry” from the more than $450 billion in Chinese goods being targeted by the US, he added.
Beijing had slammed those tariffs in a statement Sunday and vowed to “resolutely defend its rights” by filing a complaint with the World Trade Organization (WTO) and taking “corresponding countermeasures.”.
In a statement Tuesday, China's commerce ministry confirmed that it had brought the Trump administration's tariff measures to the WTO dispute settlement mechanism.
“The US practice seriously undermines the rules-based multilateral trading system, undermines the foundation of economic and trade cooperation between China and the United States, and disrupts the stability of the global industrial chain and supply chain,” the ministry said.
The Chinese measures, announced on the final day of China's week-long new year holiday, mark what could be the opening salvo of a new tit-for-tat trade war between Washington and Beijing.
However, they don't rule out the possibility of further dialogue or deal-making between the two sides.
The White House had announced the 10% tariffs on Chinese imports on Saturday as part of broader trade measures also targeting Mexico and Canada - part of what the Trump administration said was a bid to hold those countries accountable for illegal immigration and the flow of fentanyl and other drugs into the US.
Trump agreed to “immediately pause” tariffs on Mexico and Canada after holding separate calls with those countries' leaders Monday — the day before the duties on goods from all three countries were meant to come into effect.
Both leaders had agreed to strengthen security along their borders.
Trump said Monday that he expected he could speak with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in the next 24 hours.
Beijing has yet to confirm any call.
This potential exchange comes as Beijing and Washington aim to set the tone for their relationship and navigate a raft of thorny issues — including a gaping trade deficit, a tech and military rivalry and the fentanyl trade.
US law enforcement believes a number of China-based entities supply precursor chemicals, which can be used to make finished fentanyl in labs operated by drug cartels in the US and Mexico.
Canada makes up just 0.2% of US border fentanyl seizures.
Beijing has defended its efforts to control exports of the precursor chemicals used to produce fentanyl and said the latest tariffs would “erode the foundation of trust and cooperation in the field of drug control between China and the United States.” .
The Shanghai stock index was still closed Tuesday for the Lunar New Year holiday.
But stock markets elsewhere in Asia closed higher.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 2.8%.
Japan's Nikkei index was 0.7% up and South Korea's KOSPI 1.1% higher.
Both fell Monday.
The 10% duties are a far cry from the upwards of 60% tariffs that Trump had threatened to levy on China during his campaign, signaling that there could be more to come if the two sides are not able to reach a deal on a broader host of issues.
Trump campaigned on winning an economic competition against China, and, on his first day in office, ordered a review of the US-China economic relationship, which is due April 1.
The results could form the basis for additional duties on Chinese goods.
Those could address the gaping trade imbalance between the two countries, while Trump has specifically linked the 10% tariffs to the fentanyl trade.
The US president has also said he hopes that countries can reach a trade deal and work together on issues, including ending the war in Ukraine.
He also paused the enforcement of a law requiring the ban of social media app TikTok if its Chinese parent company did not divest its US business.
These issues are expected to factor into expected talks between the two countries in the weeks and months to come.
Beijing has also signaled its intention to avoid a spiraling trade war like the one seen during Trump's first term in office.
At that time, the White House slapped tariffs on hundreds of billions of US imports from China, while Beijing retaliated.
China has diversified its economy and trade partners since that time, but its export-reliant economy is grappling with slowing growth and other challenges.

Title: Women's college basketball greats Caitlin Clark and A'ja Wilson's collegiate jerseys retired | CNN
# Women's college basketball greats Caitlin Clark and A'ja Wilson's collegiate jerseys retired | CNN.
CNN — .
Caitlin Clark and A'ja Wilson , who both helped elevate the game of women's college basketball, had their respective No. 22 jersey retired Sunday at the schools where they became bona fide superstars.
Clark, the all-time leading scorer in NCAA men's and women's Division I basketball history, had her jersey raised to the rafters at Carver-Hawkeye Arena in Iowa City, Iowa, after the Iowa Hawkeyes' 76-69 upset win against the No. 4 USC Trojans.
Clark thanked her former teammates who were in attendance for the ceremony.
“I'm pretty overwhelmed right now,” the West Des Moines, Iowa, native told the sold-out crowd.
“I wouldn't be here without any of you and a lot of you came back.
You all have busy schedules and that just speaks to the culture of this place, so selfless.
I know my number is up there, but it wouldn't be if it weren't for all of you.”.
Clark led Iowa to two consecutive national title games.
In her senior season, she led the nation in scoring (31.6 per game) and assists (8.9 per game)..
She also showed some love to her former head coach and everyone who has supported her throughout her career.
“There wasn't many people when I first signed here when I said, 'I wanted to take this place to the Final Four' that they kind of laughed at me and Coach (Lisa Bluder) was literally the only person that agreed with me, thank God, or else we probably wouldn't be here.
I'm just very lucky and fortunate.”.
Clark added: “To all the people that just poured into me over the course of my career, from the people that don't get any recognition, from our media team, to our managers, all of you that have given so much of yourselves to allow me to be who I am, thank you.
I can't say it enough.
I wouldn't be here without all of you.”.
The 23-year-old is the only Division I player, man or woman, to lead her conference (Big Ten) in scoring and assists in four consecutive seasons.
She was selected to the All-Big Ten first team four times in four years, the first to ever do so in program history.
The Indiana Fever picked her with the No. 1 overall selection in the 2024 WNBA draft.
The National Player of the Year capped off a historic career at Iowa by having a groundbreaking year in her first season in the league.
Clark won the 2024 Rookie of the Year award in a near-unanimous vote.
## A'ja Wilson: 'I am overwhelmed with gratitude and joy' .
Wilson got very emotional as her jersey was lifted to the Colonial Life Arena's rafters in Columbia, South Carolina, before No. 2 Gamecocks' 83-66 victory over the Auburn Tigers.
“I am overwhelmed with gratitude and joy to have my jersey retired at the University of South Carolina, the place where my dreams began is an honor I can hardly put into words,” the school's first four-time All-American and National Player of the Year in 2018 told the Gamecock faithful.
“Columbia, South Carolina, is my home and it shaped me not just as an athlete but as a person.
As I would look up in the in the rafters and see my jersey, I'm reminded how important it is to chase your dreams without fear.”.
South Carolina's all-time leading scorer still currently holds 22 school records.
Wilson led the Gamecocks to their first Southeastern Conference (SEC) tournament title, first NCAA Final Four and first NCAA national championship.
She is also the first player in SEC history to win the Player of the Year three times.
The 28-year-old expressed gratitude to the “incredible” fans and South Carolina head coach Dawn Staley for their support.
“You fill this arena with energy and passion, making every game an unforgettable experience.

Title: How Elon Musk set off two weeks of chaos across Washington | CNN Politics
# How Elon Musk set off two weeks of chaos across Washington | CNN Politics.
Washington CNN — .
Elon Musk and his allies have spent the last two weeks barreling full speed into multiple government agencies, causing confusion and chaos and raising questions about whether an unelected businessman can wield this kind of authority, seemingly running roughshod over laws and programs set up by Congress.
Over the last several days, Musk-aligned personnel have gained full access to the Treasury's payments system, threatened to shut down the US Agency for International Development, offered all federal employees a sort of “buyout” plan, and in several agencies, pushed aside career civil servants - in some cases locking them out of their offices or computers.
Taken together, Musk's moves represent an unprecedented effort to expand the power of the executive branch with little regard for laws or procedures - an effort Donald Trump foreshadowed during his successful 2024 campaign.
Musk, the world's richest man, has tens of billions of dollars in government contracts, and now, access to the innermost workings of the federal government.
“I have a hard time thinking of anyone who has exerted the kind of power and control that he has exerted over government operations in the last week,” Kathleen Clark, a Washington University law professor who specializes in government ethics, told CNN.
The question of whether Musk will comply with federal conflict-of-interest rules - and whether the Trump administration will enforce them - has drawn scrutiny from Democrats and watchdog groups.
Multiple lawsuits are also underway, with more likely to come.
Critics accuse Musk and his allies of running afoul of laws aimed at protecting the security of federal data, while seeking to shrink or outright eliminate agencies in moves that would take an act of Congress.
After days of silence on the question of Musk's employment status, the White House on Monday indicated that Musk has been officially serving as a special government employee.
That designation means Musk isn't a volunteer but also not a full-time federal employee.
“Special government employees are sort of like super-volunteers.
They're more empowered but less encumbered,” said Kel McClanahan, the executive director of the National Security Counselors, which represents federal employees and whistleblowers and has sued the Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency in court.
A special government employee is a temporary position for someone who works, or is expected to work, for the government for 130 days or less in a 365-day period.
Musk isn't being paid, a person familiar with his employment told CNN.
He does have an office on the White House campus.
“Elon can't do and won't do anything without our approval.
And we'll give him the approval where appropriate.
Where not appropriate, we won't,” the president said on Monday.
As a special government employee, Musk is covered by a federal conflicts-of-interest statute that prohibits government employees from participating in matters that would affect their financial interests.
That law can be enforced criminally or in the civil context, but it only by the Justice Department - in this case, Trump's Justice Department.
It is unclear whether Musk has formally been appointed the administrator of the US DOGE entity created by a January 20 Trump executive order.
The White House press office hasn't responded to multiple CNN emails seeking that clarification.
Such an appointment would weigh on whether Musk is obligated under ethics rules to publicly file a financial disclosure form, said Clark.
Also relevant to that determination is whether previous occupants of the administrator role - at the DOGE predecessor agency, the US Digital Service - were highly ranked enough in government service to fall under a mandated public release of the disclosure form.
The status of the other DOGE appointees dispersed to federal agencies is also unclear, even to staffers at the agencies.
Some are now officially in employee databases and have government emails.
Others have been entering agencies under visitor badges.
Some staffers have reported having meetings with personnel who identify themselves as part of the political appointee team.
WIRED has reported that some of the staffers brought on with political appointees at the Office of Personnel Management appear to be in their early 20s.
OPM, the closest equivalent to the federal government's human resources agency, has been the source of mass emails being sent to all federal employees in recent days urging them to resign and be paid through September.
The emails' subject line - “A fork in the road” - matched one that Twitter employees received in 2022 after Musk bought the company.
And now the agency that has been trying to encourage mass resignations of federal employees is itself on the chopping block.
On Monday, senior staff at OPM had to identify 30% of their workforce they could cut in the near term, with a floated goal of an eventual 70% reduction in staff, according to two sources.
Those cuts could significantly impact OPM's ability to perform its tasks, including benefits, services and oversight.
When asked for comment on Friday, an unnamed official replied from OPM's media relations office with a short email broadly denying CNN's reporting.
The agency didn't respond when asked follow-up questions or for more specifics.
Musk himself has made several visits to the OPM offices in downtown Washington, DC, sources said.
But most alarming for the career civil servants at OPM, multiple sources told CNN, is that the political appointees have cut off nearly all the senior-level career civil servants at the agency.
Career civil servants at OPM, including those at the senior-most levels, have been physically moved out of their offices in the Office of the Director Annex and onto different floors.
Some have also lost access to internal data systems.
That has raised many alarms for civil servants concerned that the personal data, including Social Security numbers, of millions of federal employees is at risk.
“The political team has unfettered access to everything the Office of the Chief Information Officer manages,” a source at the agency told CNN.
“Many of the appointees are software engineers who are making back-end changes without regard to federal norms and requirements.
They are pulling statutorily required information off OPM.gov .” .
The agency has had strict cybersecurity protocols in place since a 2015 hack of OPM, which compromised sensitive personal information of roughly 21.5 million people from both inside and outside the government.
The hack, which US officials have blamed on Chinese spies, forced OPM and other federal agencies to overhaul their cyber defenses.
The agency now faces a lawsuit, brought by McClanahan's firm on behalf of two anonymous federal employees, accusing the administration of failing to conduct a required data security assessment when setting up an OPM email distribution system for mass emails to the entire federal civil service.
Some of Musk's top lieutenants have been working directly at OPM or advising at the agency since the inauguration.
They include Steve Davis, the CEO of the Boring Company who helped Musk during the purge of Twitter staffers in 2022, as well as now OPM senior adviser Brian Bjelde, who had been vice president of people operations at SpaceX, and Amanda Scales, now OPM's chief of staff who until January worked in talent at Musk's xAI company.
Trump's nominee to run OPM, Scott Kupor, who is awaiting confirmation, also holds deep ties to the Silicon Valley universe integral to Musk's DOGE operations.
Kupor comes from Andreessen Horowitz, the powerhouse tech venture capital shop co-founded by Marc Andreessen.
Andreessen, a legend in the tech space, was closely involved in advising Trump's transition operation.
The appointed acting director of the agency - Charles “Chuck” Ezell - was until January, an OPM branch chief for data analytics in Georgia, a jump in seniority that shocked current and former OPM staff.
Shortly after Trump's inauguration, top career staffers at USAID - which Musk has branded a “criminal organization” that should “die” - were placed on immediate leave.
The entire executive team and every deputy in the agency, which dispenses billions in humanitarian aid and development funding annually, were suddenly gone.
According to sources, personnel from the Musk-created office then physically tried to access the USAID headquarters in Washington, DC, and were stopped.
The DOGE personnel demanded to be let in and threatened to call US Marshals to be allowed access, two of the sources said.
The DOGE personnel wanted to gain access to USAID security systems and personnel files, three sources said.
Two of those sources also said the DOGE personnel wanted access to classified information, which only those with security clearances and a specific need to know are able to access.
Eventually they were able to access the headquarters.
On Sunday night, Musk said Trump had agreed the agency should be shut down.
By Monday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced he was now acting administrator of USAID.
Its website was offline and remaining staff were told to work from home.
But critics have argued that Trump can't unilaterally abolish USAID, whose existence is written into federal law and whose budget comes from congressional appropriations.
“The president has zero legal authority to 'shut down,' defund, or otherwise cripple a $50 billion agency.
Audit it, identify unnecessary expenditures, draft reform or rescission proposals, and then go to Congress to PASS A LAW,” Brian Riedl, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, wrote on X .
## Cuts and new faces at GSA .
A quiet but similarly consequential Musk-driven mission has been underway at the General Services Administration, which oversees federal real estate and procurement.
The same day Trump took the oath of office, GSA employees received an email from the newly appointed acting head of the agency that highlighted the need for GSA to commit itself to “ensuring government-wide efficiency and maximizing value for the American taxpayer,” according to a copy read to CNN.
Stephen Ehikian, a former Salesforce executive who most recently worked in AI, was tapped to serve as the agency's deputy administrator and has taken on the role of acting head of GSA until a Trump nominee is confirmed for the role.
The efficiency mandate, Ehikian wrote, was “effective immediately.”.
Ehikian's email also served as the internal announcement of a series of new appointees across key roles in the agency.
They include Thomas Shedd, who is taking over the leadership of the Technology Transformation Services, the essential government unit for the government's technology products and services.
Shedd spent the previous eight years building software for vehicle and battery factories at Tesla, Musk's car company.
His approach in the new role carries echoes of Musk's private-sector strategies, one of the people familiar with the matter said, citing a Shedd email this week to hundreds of GSA employees to schedule “touch-base” sessions and bring with them an example of a recent “technical win.”.
In addition to managing the federal government's real estate, GSA manages some of the most massive government contracts.
Critics have questioned the inherent conflict of interest in Musk's associates working within the GSA, even though they all should have signed nondisclosure agreements.
Musk has billions of dollars in government contracts, and one source familiar with the situation noted that some of his closest associates now have access to “sensitive and often classified acquisitions information for billions of dollars in government contracts.”.
According to two sources familiar with the situation at GSA, every office agency must present proposals this week to cut 50% of their business expenses, in addition to the GSA efforts to significantly reduce the federal government's real estate footprint.
The GSA didn't respond to a request for comment.
Late last week, the DOGE appointees were granted full access to the government's payments system after the top civil servant at the Treasury Department, David Lebryk, left his job unexpectedly.
The DOGE appointees had clashed with Lebryk after they expressed interest in stopping certain payments made by the federal government, according to three people familiar with the situation.
Musk himself acknowledged his interest in the Treasury Department's payment processing in a middle-of-the-night post on his social media platform Saturday.
He wrote his team “discovered, among other things, that payment approval officers at Treasury were instructed always to approve payments, even to known fraudulent or terrorist groups.
They literally never denied a payment in their entire career.
Not even once.”.
The post appeared to ignore the mechanisms already in place for Treasury to simply fulfill lawful payment decisions made by other agencies, and that the system's value to the federal bureaucracy and the nation's economy lies in its reliability.
The Treasury moves have spurred a lawsuit, filed Monday on behalf of government unions and others, alleging a “massive and unprecedented” intrusion into private government data.
It adds to a pile of lawsuits that has grown quickly in the last two weeks, in some cases halting the administration's actions.
“That's why this whole mishmash is so troubling,” McClanahan said.
“They have managed to break so many rules and so many laws with some fairly simple actions that a lot of lawyers and a lot of people in the media and politicians and everyone get tangled up on. …
You're basically punching smoke when you're trying to litigate against this.”.

Title: Trump says banning TikTok won't make Americans safer from China.
He may have a point | CNN Business
# Trump says banning TikTok won't make Americans safer from China.
He may have a point | CNN Business.
New York CNN — .
President Donald Trump on Wednesday batted down the national security concerns surrounding TikTok, saying, “Is it that important for China to be spying on young people?
On young kids watching crazy videos?”.
It was a surprising comment coming from the guy who first tried to ban TikTok from the United States over worries that the Chinese government could use the app to gather intelligence on Americans.
In his 2020 executive order that unsuccessfully tried to ban the app, Trump said TikTok's data collection could allow China's government “to track the locations of Federal employees and contractors, build dossiers of personal information for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage.” .
Since Trump's 2020 executive order , US lawmakers have largely agreed that it poses a risk.
State and federal government agencies and the military have restricted staff from downloading the app on their work devices, beginning during Trump's first term.
And last year, Congress passed a law with bipartisan support requiring parent company ByteDance to sell TikTok to a non-Chinese owner or face a ban, which the Supreme Court upheld on national security grounds.
But Trump's comment about data security — while dramatically oversimplified — may have some merit.
Some privacy and technology experts say simply transferring control of TikTok to a new owner won't be a silver bullet to protect US users' data from China, given that Beijing has plenty of other avenues for accessing information about Americans.
Other social media platforms and websites collect similar data to TikTok — such as location data, search history and purchase history — and many other sites sell that data to data brokers, which make it available online for any willing buyer.
“The Chinese government can simply buy US user data from data brokers.
It is widely available,” Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told CNN's “Terms of Service” podcast earlier this month.
“If US lawmakers really cared about protecting American users' data from the Chinese government, they would pass comprehensive data privacy legislation that would limit what kind of data all companies can collect and what kind of data all companies can sell,” she said. (TikTok CEO Shou Chew testified before Congress in 2023 that the company does not sell to data brokers.) .
China also has advanced cyber-espionage capabilities that in just the past year have allowed the country to spy on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, the government office that reviews foreign investments for national security risk, as well as American telecom networks .
Data collection isn't the only concern surrounding TikTok.
US lawmakers worry that the Chinese government could force ByteDance to manipulate the TikTok algorithm , to spread Chinese propaganda or disinformation, or to sow discord among Americans. .
But even then, Chinese government actors have also successfully weaponized US-owned social media platforms to spread disinformation and harass Americans. (TikTok has also denied that Beijing would have access to manipulate its algorithm.) .
Still, contrary to Trump's point, TikTok is far more than just “young kids watching crazy videos.”
Around half of the US population — 170 million Americans — use the platform, often to discuss news, politics and world events.
Trump's comment may be aimed at garnering support for his proposal that, rather than a wholesale transfer of US TikTok to an American buyer, the United States and China could share control of the platform as a 50-50 joint venture.
It's unclear if that suggestion would satisfy the letter of the TikTok sale-or-ban law, which seeks to prevent a foreign adversary from controlling such a popular social media platform.
The reversal in Trump's stance on TikTok has raised questions about why he is apparently less concerned now about TikTok threatening US national security.
Trump has said he changed his mind because he “got to use it.” .
One explanation “could be that China is less powerful than it was five years ago.
Their economy isn't as strong as it used to be; internationally, they're less vocal and active and influential,” said Sarah Kreps, director of the Tech Policy Institute at Cornell University.
But, Kreps said, that alone “doesn't seem enough to me to explain why there was such a national security concern a few years ago and now this is kind of being waved off as not a concern,” especially given China's ongoing interest in and success in spying on Americans through other means, she said.
Still, whether TikTok's US operations are sold in part or entirely, it could be difficult — if not impossible — to ensure that Beijing no longer has any means of controlling it, given that the technology originated in China.
“Whether you have 25%, 50%, 99% American-owned, it's a legitimate question of whether from an engineering perspective, you can disentangle this Chinese control within the source code from TikTok itself,” Kreps said.
TikTok, for its part, has tried for years to assuage US concerns by storing American users' data in Oracle-owned servers in the United States, offering access for third-party monitors to review its systems and saying it could not be accessed by its China-based parent company even if Beijing officials demanded it — albeit unsuccessfully.
Although it may not be a perfect solution, some experts say the sale of TikTok — in its entirety — is still crucial for US national security because of the potential that China could use TikTok's trove of user data and manipulate the app's algorithm to target Americans with specific videos they might be inclined to believe or engage with.
Justice Brett Kavanaugh summarized that concern from Congress in the Supreme Court hearing earlier this month over TikTok's challenge to the sale-or-ban law, which the court shot down.
American lawmakers, Kavanaugh said, “were concerned that China was accessing information about millions of Americans, tens of millions of Americans, including teenagers, people in their twenties” and that the country could use that information “to turn people, to blackmail people — people who a generation from now will be working in the FBI or the CIA or in the State Department.”.
“I think that's where it gets really, truly dangerous from a national security perspective,” said Lindsay Gorman, managing director of the German Marshall Fund's technology program.
In theory, ByteDance, at the behest of China, could use “this incredibly powerful tool to influence Americans at the… individual level toward certain views and certain actions.”.

Title: I don't have diabetes, but I wore a glucose monitor for six weeks.
Here's what I learned about food (and anxiety) | CNN
# I don't have diabetes, but I wore a glucose monitor for six weeks.
Here's what I learned about food (and anxiety) | CNN.
CNN — .
One day in September, I stood in front of my open refrigerator, ravenous but unable to figure out what I should eat.
I was worried that whatever I chose to eat would cause the new app on my phone to record a spike in my glucose levels that would count against the number I was allowed that day - and I was determined to conquer this algorithm.
I'd just put on a continuous glucose monitor, a device that sticks to your arm and uses a tiny needle to provide near-real-time information about how much sugar is circulating in your blood - not because I have diabetes, the main use for what are called CGMs, but because these devices are starting to be marketed as wellness tools for everybody, and I wanted to see how they work.
Apple?
Too sugary.
Granola bar?
Hello, glucose spike.
Cheese - that's the ticket.
A few days of wearing this monitor had taught me that cheese would not cause my glucose to go up.
“Is this thing just inadvertently putting you on the keto diet ?” my husband - who'd witnessed a few episodes of hanger while I was trying to figure out how to please my CGM - finally asked.
Pretty much.
Avoiding carbohydrates and prioritizing protein and fat, often together, didn't lead to spikes in glucose that my CGM and app, Lingo from the health company Abbott, would count against me.
But because I wasn't aiming to switch to a very low-carb, ketogenic diet, I initially struggled to figure out what to eat; in the first week or so of wearing the CGM, my scale read my weight at 3 pounds lower than usual - a blip, I presume, because I was too nervous to eat normally.
This is not, unsurprisingly, how experts say CGMs should be used, whether you have diabetes or not.
Continuous glucose monitors have been revolutionary for people with type 1 diabetes, for whom glucose levels are life and death, providing information about how much insulin they need to inject to keep their blood sugar stable.
The alternative is finger-stick testing , pricking fingertips to draw drops of blood to check glucose levels, often multiple times a day.
“CGMs are life-changing for insulin-dependent diabetics,” said Laura Marston , an attorney and advocate for lower insulin prices who was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes as a teenager.
Before she got a CGM, she said, she'd go long periods without checking her glucose levels through finger-stick tests, instead adjusting her insulin doses based on how she was feeling, leading to hospitalizations with a dangerous condition known as diabetic ketoacidosis .
Now, Marston said, she knows her glucose level every five minutes with a CGM, and her A1C, another measure of glucose in the blood, is steadily at a much better level - something she attributes both to the CGM and to focusing more on dealing with diabetes and having steadier health insurance.
In that context, CGMs are medical devices, requiring prescriptions and - usually , but not always - receiving coverage through health insurance.
CGMs can be covered for people with type 2 diabetes who use insulin, as well.
But this year, Dexcom and Abbott , the two major makers of CGMs, introduced biosensors for people who don't use insulin, available without a prescription and for about $89 a month out of pocket.
Dexcom's offering, called Stelo, was cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration in March, based on data from a clinical study showing that the device performed similarly to other CGMs.
In an FDA release, Dr. Jeff Shuren, then director of the agency's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said that “CGMs can be a powerful tool to help monitor blood glucose” and that “giving more individuals valuable information about their health, regardless of their access to a doctor or health insurance, is an important step forward in advancing health equity for US patients.”.
Abbott's Lingo was cleared in June and is targeted specifically for “consumers who want to better understand and improve their health and wellness,” the company said in a news release.
The idea is that seeing near-instantaneous feedback to the glucose effects of food, exercise, sleep and stress might give people insights about unique ways their bodies react to different inputs and help them make changes to improve their health.
I was excited to try it.
Putting the device on was surprisingly painless, and an hour after the little disc was secured to my arm, I started seeing my glucose levels on the accompanying app on my phone.
“117,” I messaged Dr. Jody Dushay , a physician at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center who works with people with obesity and diabetes and who'd offered to review my CGM findings with me.
The Lingo app told me that was within what it called a “typical healthy glucose range” of 70 to 140 milligrams per deciliter, noting that “occasionally, you may find yourself over 140 mg/dL or under 70 mg/dL, which is expected.”.
Dushay had warned me before I put on the CGM that blood sugar could range from the high 50s when fasting to the 150s after eating in a generally healthy young woman.
She also emphasized that continuous glucose monitoring shouldn't be used to diagnose prediabetes or diabetes.
Her caution about how I might react to seeing my data turned out to be warranted.
In the first week I wore the monitor, I was glued to the app, watching my glucose rise shortly after eating.
The app accumulates metrics that it calls Lingo Counts to try to help users make sense of the data, with a higher number associated with a bigger or longer elevation of glucose.
Although the app gave me an initial target of 60 or under for my daily Lingo Count, I found myself trying to keep it as low as possible, a tendency reinforced by the app's suggestions to do 20 squats after lunch to “find some balance” as my count was going up.
I ended up keeping my count so low initially that the app reset my daily target to 22, which I exceeded frequently once some of my anxiety wore off.
And although the finding that cheese didn't lead to a glucose spike wasn't a huge surprise, there were a few other readings that were interesting.
A salad with chopped vegetables and quinoa that I thought was a healthy choice for a quick lunch registered one of my largest Lingo Counts of the week, probably because of the sugar in the peanut dressing.
A glass of wine and a slice of pizza, on the other hand, didn't cause a glucose surge - a happy revelation but not one that I can pretend will lead to better health.
“Your values are all completely normal,” Dushay told me when I sent her screengrabs of my glucose levels.
“What look like 'spikes' are perfectly fine excursions within the normal range.”.
But could those increases, even within a normal range, give me feedback on ways I could feel healthier?
Stay full longer?
Have more energy?
Lower my risk of metabolic disease?
Or would I learn only that, as Marston put it, my “pancreas functions as it should”?.
It depends on whom you ask; the scientific community appears to be divided on the value of continuous glucose monitoring for people who don't have diabetes, a gulf that researchers say is exacerbated by a lack of data.
There are “definitely a lot of strong opinions in the field,” said Dr. Nicole Spartano , an assistant professor at Boston University's Chobanian and Avedisian School of Medicine who studies CGM use in non-diabetic people.
Spartano said she conducted a study in which she surveyed clinicians who had expertise on CGMs and asked them to interpret about 20 reports on glucose levels in people without diabetes.
“There's no consensus about how they view the data,” she said.
“Some people think high spikes are bad; some people think they're meaningless in people without diabetes; some people think, 'if it's a prolonged period of a glucose excursion,'” over 180 or so, those people should be screened for diabetes;
“other experts will see that and say that person is fine.”.
Dr. Robert Lustig , professor emeritus of pediatrics in the Division of Endocrinology at the University of California San Francisco, who's written several books warning against excess sugar and processed foods, is in the camp that says keeping glucose down is crucial.
He argues that continuous glucose monitoring is useful for people without diabetes - if users get the right help interpreting their data.
“Not everybody responds to the same foods as everyone else,” said Lustig, who's an adviser to a company called Levels that offers continuous glucose monitoring along with an app.
“The goal is to keep your glucose down, because when you keep your glucose down, you keep your insulin down, and when you keep your insulin down, then the insulin is not there to drive energy into fat, and it's not there to cause cell growth, which is at the heart of chronic metabolic disease.” .
Lustig acknowledged that people using CGMs could experience the same anxiety I initially felt about the glucose data - but argued that anxiety could be lessened if users receive more help interpreting the information.
And Dushay and Spartano emphasized that it would be particularly important for people who have a history of disordered eating or other food anxiety to talk with health-care providers before using a CGM.
But for some, the devices provide surprising insights about how different people react to foods - like CNN's chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta , who's worn a CGM along with his wife, Rebecca.
Neither has diabetes, but they were curious about what they could learn to potentially improve their health.
“When I eat blueberries, my glucose will not spike at all,” he said.
“When she eats blueberries, her glucose will immediately spike.”.
With rice, he said, it's the opposite: His glucose spikes, while Rebecca's doesn't.
An Indian flatbread he's been eating since he was a kid also caused a major increase.
And sometimes, Gupta said, his glucose can go up to 180 milligrams per deciliter.
With a history of diabetes in his family, which he's discussed on his “ Chasing Life ” podcast, that's enough to make him want to avoid those foods.
After four weeks of wearing a CGM - each biosensor device lasts two weeks - I decided to take a break and formulate a better plan before I applied my third and final monitor.
I realized that the way I'd approached it the first time around was, as Dushay put it, “an artificial experiment”: I wasn't using the CGM to get feedback about how I normally eat; I was eating abnormally in immediate response to the CGM.
“Your first biosensor [should be] a look at what you've been doing over time, kind of what your body's been experiencing, even though you didn't have that peek behind the curtain,” said Pam Nisevich Bede , nutritionist for Abbott's Lingo business.
“And then you're starting to experiment with a few different food choices, timing of meals, et cetera.
And then with your next biosensor, you're going to be fine-tuning those habits.” .
I decided not to look at my glucose levels for the first week of wearing the final monitor, recording my food by hand and entering it into the app at the end of each day.
And in the second week, I'd try to make changes.
I also repeated some meals to measure whether my glucose response was consistent, as a National Institutes of Health study found significant variability in CGM readings even in the same person to the same food, according to its author, Dr. Kevin Hall , a senior investigator with the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.
I'd just baked banana bread with my kids, so I repeated that for breakfast a few times that week and generated a fairly consistent increase in glucose, registering a 10 on my Lingo Count one day and an 11 another.
On a third day, exercising afterwards blunted my Lingo Count by a few points.
Even so, my glucose never exceeded about 136 milligrams per deciliter, even at its highest after banana bread.
Swapping in Greek yogurt or chia pudding appeared to avoid accumulating Lingo Counts, although I'm not sure I needed a CGM to tell me those might be better choices than banana bread for breakfast.
One thing the CGM did do was nudge me to avoid snacking mindlessly, which may be the kind of small behavioral modification that can make a difference.
I didn't want to have to track every bite of graham cracker I indulged in during my kids' afternoon snack or to see the resulting increases in glucose on my app.
“I think there's a place for it in terms of behavioral management,” said Spartano, who's leading research into whether CGMs can predict the development of diabetes as part of the Framingham Heart Study .
“We're just really early in this research space.” .

# Why I'm not setting New Year's resolutions | CNN.
CNN — .
Editor's Note: Channon Hodge is a video producer at CNN, overseeing digital video content for Travel and Wellness. .
I understand the benefits of making New Year's resolutions.
I've seen the brain science on how to make them work.
The idea of slicing and dicing goals into micro-atomic resolutions that will make life so much better all sounds lovely.
I just can't do it.
I'm a news producer coming out of a year filled with one horrific global event after another.
I'm also a single mom by choice of a 20-month-old.
I adore him but I barely made it to 2025.
I'm not sure I'll make it to 2026.
That's why I've made no plans to try harder, set an intention or try to improve on anything.
What I did do, however, was revisit some of the six months of company-sponsored therapy I tried in 2024 to figure out why I'm so enraged by my friends' well-intentioned New Year's Instagram posts.
I also did some research, called up a psychologist and queried my discussion groups of single moms.
Then it was Niecy Nash-Betts and Snoop Dogg to the rescue.
Their speeches after being honored for their work popped up as viral videos on my social media feeds, giving me the words I needed to tie all that advice together.
I started searching online to learn more about my lack of motivation, and I found a theory called the “progress principle.”
It came from researchers who poured through more than 12,000 diary entries from over 200 people working at several chosen companies.
In 2007, researchers Teresa M. Amabile and Steven J. Kramer found that what separated a worker's good day from a bad one was whether that day contained progress or setbacks . ( Amabile is now the Edsel Bryant Ford Professor of Business Administration, Emerita, at Harvard Business School, and Kramer is an independent researcher and writer.) .
Good days contained some sort of minor but meaningful step forward in completing a project .
A setback proved to be demotivating, and multiple setbacks led to burnout.
This simple and somewhat rational finding became the foundation of the book “ The Progress Principle: Using Small Wins to Ignite Joy, Engagement, and Creativity at Work ” by Amabile and Kramer and an important thread in the study of productivity and motivation in the workplace.
Clinical psychologist Melanie McNally also touched on the importance of recognizing progress when she wrote about a high-achieving but frustrated client.
McNally's article in Psychology Today spoke to me about my yearslong lull, so I called her up to learn more.
“So often what people do is they're just constantly moving the goalposts, just moving on to the next thing,” McNally told CNN.
“And that's not helpful.
That's what leads to burnout.”.
I realized this theory doesn't just describe work.
It describes parenthood.
When my son finally stopped waking up three times a night for feedings, he suddenly stopped taking a bottle (which meant I could never leave his side).
Ugh.
When he finally started taking a bottle again a few months later, he refused to try solids other than applesauce.
When he started trying solids, he regressed on sleep training.
I spent 18 months moving from one goalpost to another, feeling the entire time like I was nearly failing as a mom.
My parenting chat groups are full of these dominoing challenges, none more vivid in my recent chats than that faced by Melissa Carter, also a single mom by choice.
Her toddler spent days in the intensive care unit for respiratory syncytial virus, known as RSV, and pneumonia.
For parents who are couples, hospitalization for your child is devastating.
For a single parent, it is also lonely and completely destabilizing.
It leads some single parents to question whether they can manage at all.
Melissa was the first to answer my query asking if anyone was making resolutions.
Yes, she told me, sort of.
She's thought about this “moment of beginning” a lot, and as an adjunct assistant professor of public service and senior director for Global Spiritual Life at New York University, she's developed a resilience I admire.
She doesn't care for resolutions either.
Instead, she focuses on one word for the year.
Last year's word was “alignment.”
It helped her think about staying true to who she was, which she has discovered can be two different people when it comes to parenting her son, Sage.
“Sage's mom is a bad ass,” she told me.
“She was like a pit bull in that hospital.
You know?
And then there's Melissa, that is also quite amazing, successful, and has her own wounds and her own history that she also has to work through.”.
The application of progress theory to parenthood makes sense, McNally told me.
It's also a connection therapists have made to help all sorts of struggling clients reinforce positivity.
Half of McNally's clients are teenagers and, by extension, their parents are included.
She holds parent group meetings and starts each one by asking everyone to share a small win, a moment of progress, for a key reason:.
To profit from progress, Amabile and Kramer's research and other findings that followed realized that small wins must be celebrated.
Big wins are rare, these advocates said, but celebrating a small one can be a powerful catalyst for the brain and for self-esteem.
If you're just moving from one challenge to the next, the brain associates achievement with stress, which, over the long term, can lead to burnout, McNally said.
She added that instead, you want the brain to connect achievement to pleasure .
Celebration gets you a little hit of dopamine and then comes the bigger benefit.
“Your brain gets to really feel what you've done and what you've achieved,” McNally said.
“You make that direct connection between the reward and the achievement.
So now when you go on to the next thing, it's almost like you have some closure because you've celebrated this thing.”.
I started to think that I inadvertently missed out on a whole lot of celebration.
And look, throughout the year, people told me I was a great mom, but it felt strange to hear and I didn't know why.
So what was wrong?
McNally said these accolades can sometimes feel too generic and that can then feel disingenuous, even when they're kindly meant.
In acknowledging progress or wins, specificity and even material rewards can help.
So buying myself two croissants the morning after my son slept through the night after a week of nightly wakeups was right for me. (But there are not enough croissants in all of Brooklyn for the year I've had.) .
So here comes Niecy Nash-Betts.
After decades acting in movies, hosting one of my favorite reality shows, “Clean House,” and creating a deadpan yet hilarious cop on “Reno 911!,” Nash-Betts finally won an Emmy in 2024 for a dramatic role.
On stage, she thanked God, Netflix, the voters and then added:.
“I want to thank me for believing in me and doing what they say I could not do!
And I want to say to myself, in front of all of you beautiful people, go on, girl, with your bad self,” said Nash-Betts , who won the best supporting actress award in a limited or anthology series or movie for “Dahmer-Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story.” .
Supporting Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie: 75th Emmy Awards.
She later told “Entertainment Tonight” she had to push hard to get the industry to realize she was more than just funny.
“It's not called mamma-esteem and us-esteem and them-esteem,” she said while holding her Emmy that night.
“It's called self-esteem because done nobody gotta believe it but you.”.
She wasn't the first to go viral for thanking herself.
Snoop Dogg did the same in 2018 when he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
What Snoop Dogg and Nash-Betts led me to believe is that it shouldn't be unorthodox to acknowledge your own accomplishments.
In doing so, you can believe in yourself without waiting for others to believe in you, too.
Saying thank you was the least I could do for a mom who tried really, really hard.
My “one word” — thanks — is a small way to celebrate a year of wins.
I could add some croissants for good measure.
I told McNally, the clinical psychologist, that I was going to spend some time in 2025 acknowledging my progress over the past year.
She told me that was a good idea, adding, in a way only a therapist can, that it might help me approach challenges differently this year.
That sounds like a resolution.
She told me to go for it but to be specific and write it down.
So, for the first time in the four decades that I've spent writing journals, essays and stories, I start to write it out.
Channon, I want to thank you.
Thank you for trying to scoop up all that water using a dishpan when it started flooding your garden apartment.
Thank you for giving up your garden and moving somewhere new with a toddler in tow.
Thank you for spending six months carrying your breast pump, your laptop, your measly collection of milk, your container of cafeteria food that would turn into your dinner and your 15-pound child up two flights of stairs into your new apartment all those days you had to go to the office.
Thank you for eventually thinking of those two flights of stairs as your gym substitute and then still joining a gym because the one-month free promo got to you.
Thank you for crying when you needed to, even that one time in Bryant Park after your eye doctor's receptionist snickered because you'd missed an important appointment while trying to get to a funeral you also missed, but you're doing amazing and the sobs came, and those two teenage girls in the park were glaring at you and you didn't give them the finger.
Like, that specific?
Yes.

# De'Aaron Fox reportedly to join the San Antonio Spurs as the Sacramento Kings acquire Zach LaVine in more NBA trade drama | CNN.
CNN — .
All-Star guard De'Aaron Fox is on the verge of joining the San Antonio Spurs as part of a three-team deal which will see the Chicago Bulls' Zach LaVine sign with the Sacramento Kings , according to ESPN's Shams Charania .
Through a complex deal which involves multiple players and draft picks, the Spurs are set to pair Fox with 2024 Rookie of the Year Victor Wembanyama , who is continuing his ascent towards stardom and is due to make his All-Star debut on February 16.
Fox - averaging 25.0 points, 6.1 assists and 5.0 rebounds this season - is ranked fourth on the Kings' all-time scoring list having been selected by Sacramento with the fifth overall pick in 2017.
He will likely be relishing the opportunity to play alongside Wembanyama, who is averaging 24.6 points, 10.9 rebounds and 3.7 assists in 2024-25.
Fox had reportedly been unwilling to commit his long-term future to the Kings, who, in acquiring LaVine, will reunite the 29-year-old with his former Bulls teammate DeMar DeRozan.
LaVine has enjoyed a resurgence this season and is currently averaging 24.0 points, 4.8 rebounds and 4.5 assists.
The Kings will hope that he, alongside DeRozan and three-time All-Star Domantas Sabonis, can propel Sacramento to its second playoff appearance in 19 seasons.
The team is currently 24-24 and 10th in the Western Conference.
News of the trade comes shortly after the stunning revelation that Luka Dončić is joining the Los Angeles Lakers from the Dallas Mavericks, with big man Anthony Davis moving in the opposite direction.
Fox and LaVine will join Dončić and Davis as the four players averaging at least 20 points who have been traded before the deadline this season, the most in NBA history according to ESPN.
The deal will also see five other players make moves, as well as seven draft picks change hands.
Alongside Fox, the Spurs will also acquire fellow Kings guard Jordan McLaughlin.
In addition to LaVine, the Kings get Spurs guard Sidy Cissoko, three first-round picks (from the Charlotte Hornets in 2025, the Spurs in 2027 and the Minnesota Timberwolves in 2031) and three second-round picks (from the Bulls in 2025, the Nuggets in 2028, and their own pick back from the Bulls in 2028)..
As well as their own pick back from the Spurs in 2025, the Bulls bring in three players: Spurs forward Zach Collins, Spurs guard Tre Jones and Kings guard Kevin Huerter.

Title: With no evidence, Trump blamed DEI for a plane crash | CNN Business
# With no evidence, Trump blamed DEI for a plane crash | CNN Business.
New York CNN — .
President Donald Trump on Thursday blamed the Federal Aviation Administration's “diversity push” in part for the plane collision that killed 67 people in Washington, DC.
But DEI backers, including most top US companies, believe a push for diversity has been good for their businesses.
Trump did not cite any evidence for how efforts to hire more minorities, people with disabilities and other groups less represented in American workforces led to the crash, saying “it just could have been” and that he had “common sense.”
But Trump criticized the FAA's effort to recruit people with disabilities during Joe Biden's administration, even though the FAA's Aviation Safety Workforce Plan for the 2020-2029 period, issued under Trump's first administration, promoted and supported “the hiring of people with disabilities and targeted disabilities.” .
It's not the first time opponents of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, or DEI, have said they can kill people.
“DEI means people DIE,” Elon Musk said after the California wildfires , criticizing the Los Angeles Fire Department and city and state officials for their efforts to advance diversity in their workforces.
The Trump administration has clamped down on DEI in the federal government, ordering government DEI employees to be placed on leave, ending the use of DEI in hiring and federal contracting, and other measures to end DEI practices.
In the business world, DEI is typically a mix of recruiting practices, employee training and other measures to boost representation of people of different races, genders, classes, religions and other backgrounds.
Rather than lower hiring standards, supporters say DEI broadens the pool of people employers would consider for a job, in theory finding even more qualified people for tasks than they would have found in the past.
Companies that abandon efforts to promote diversity and inclusion risk missing out on the best talent, business leaders say.
“At its best, DEI is about developing talent, measuring it in a fair way and finding hidden talent and disadvantaged talent in a world where not everybody has an equal chance to exhibit their abilities,” Ken Frazier, the first Black chief executive of a major pharmaceutical company, told CNN in an October interview .
DEI initiatives have been shown to boost profits, reduce employee attrition and increase employee motivation, according to Boston Consulting Group research based on data from more than 27,000 employees in 16 countries.
Amid growing opposition from right-wing activists, lawsuits from conservative legal groups, demand from conservative-leaning customers and other factors, many high-profile companies have stepped back from some of their DEI pledges.
Walmart, McDonald's, Target, Harley-Davidson, Ford and many others have made changes to their DEI initiatives.
However, most companies remain committed to DEI.
The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that opposes DEI, found in November that 486 of the Fortune 500 companies still have a statement or corporate commitment to DEI on their websites.
Most of the changes companies like Walmart and Target have made are “cosmetic” and “inconsequential,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, the president of the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute.
Companies are adjusting language or repositioning programs rather than abandoning their commitments to expand diversity.
“Most of the leaders I speak to absolutely see the value [of diversity],” said Tarang Amin, the CEO of e.l.f.
Beauty, a cosmetics company that has stood behind its DEI programs.
“There's just so much data that says diverse teams perform better than homogeneous teams, that diverse thought really drives better outcomes.” .
Bigger companies are standing firmly behind DEI, too.
Costco recently rejected a proposal brought by a conservative think tank, the National Center for Public Policy Research, that would have required Costco to report on the financial risks of maintaining its diversity and inclusion goals.
The group criticized Costco for possible “illegal discrimination” against employees who are “white, Asian, male or straight.” .
Costco said its DEI efforts help the company attract and retain a wide range of employees and improve merchandise and services in stores.
Costco also said its members want to interact with a diverse employee base.
“Among other things, a diverse group of employees helps bring originality and creativity to our merchandise offerings, promoting the 'treasure hunt' that our customers value,” Costco said in its proxy statement to investors.
Efforts at diversity, equity and inclusion “enhance our capacity to attract and retain employees who will help our business succeed.” .

Title: What is a tariff and how does it work?

# What is a tariff and how does it work?
| CNN Business.
New York CNN — .
Tariffs have dominated headlines since President Donald Trump took office just over two weeks ago, as he threatened steep, sweeping tariffs on goods the United States imports from its three largest trading partners — Mexico, China and Canada — on Tuesday.
These tariffs risk making a wide range of goods Americans buy much more expensive — and could also hurt domestic businesses if the three countries respond with retaliatory tariffs on American goods.
But for all this talk about tariffs, you may be wondering: What exactly is a tariff and how does it work?.
Hours before 25% tariffs were set to go into effect on all Mexican and most Canadian goods, Trump said he reached agreements with leaders of both nations to delay enacting new tariffs for at least another month.
However, a 10% tariff on all goods coming to the US from China took effect at 12:01 a.m. ET on Tuesday.
China immediately retaliated with tariffs on some energy and metals imports.
The definition of a tariff is fairly straightforward — it's a tax on goods coming from another country.
They are typically structured as a percentage of the value of the import and can vary based on where the goods are coming from and what the products are.
Domestic businesses that import products into the country pay the tariffs up front, contrary to Trump's claims that exporting nations foot the bill.
The actual transaction occurs at the 328 points of entry into the US designated by Customs and Border Protection to take in imports, including airports, railways, roads and ports.
At those ports of entry, CBP agents collect tariff revenue from the domestic businesses importing the products, which is calculated based on how the merchandise is classified and where it came from, said Ted Murphy, a lawyer at Sidley Austin who specializes in advising businesses on customs compliance issues.
Many importers use the government's electronic payment system , which automatically deducts tariff from a designated bank account.
It's also possible to pay it all at once on a monthly basis rather than having it automatically deducted each time.
But Trump isn't entirely wrong in saying that other nations pay for tariffs levied on them, Murphy said.
That's because when businesses know they'll have to spend more to import goods from one country versus another, they may decide it makes more financial sense to find a new supplier elsewhere or, in Trump's ideal world, shift their production to the US.
In either case, the economy of the country whose goods are tariffed can suffer from the loss of revenue, potentially resulting in job losses.
However, exporting nations often don't just accept tariffs without fighting back.
Sometimes those countries respond with retaliatory tariffs, launching what often turns into a full-fledged tade war of tit-for-tat tariffs.

Title: McCormick predicts this flavor will dominate menus in 2025 | CNN Business
# McCormick predicts this flavor will dominate menus in 2025 | CNN Business.
New York CNN — .
The “swicy” trend is far from over.
In fact, a spice that combines both the sweet and spicy trends is about to have a breakthrough year.
McCormick , the top-selling maker of seasonings and spices, has named ají amarillo as its 2025 “Flavor of the Year.”
The 25th edition of the influential report identifies trending spices and seasonings about to hit restaurant menus or in cookbooks.
Ají amarillo is chili pepper native to South America and has vibrant fruit notes reminiscent of passion fruit or a mango, along with a moderate dash of heat similar to cayenne pepper.
“The balance of sweetness and heat that it brings makes it a very flavorful and balanced pepper that can be added to many different dishes,” according to Hadar Cohen Aviram, McCormick's executive chef that is leading the report.
Ají amarillo also lives up to its “yellow chili pepper” translation in English, because the spice has a distinctive hue that gives dishes and drinks an “aesthetic appeal,” she added.
The seasoning brings a “freshness and brightness” to a variety of foods, including charred vegetables or meats, dips, vinaigrettes and even distilled into a simple syrup for cocktails.
McCormick deploys a global team of about 50 people, such as chefs, marketers and food technologists with a “passion for food innovation” to identify a flavor that is “both innovative and reflective of global culinary movements,” Aviram told CNN.
Ají amarillo was a clear standout in the team's research because it was an “interesting standalone ingredient on many menus and it made us look twice” at it, she said.
Researchers spotted it on charred broccoli in London, drizzled in a tangy sauce on oysters in Australia and swirled in a tropical cocktail in Canada, so the spice “really is something global outside of its original context.”.
Aviram admitted there's a learning curve with ají amarillo, but that's intentional because they “want it to be an inception” and the report is about “defining the future of flavor.”
McCormick predicts that the spice will increase on menu appearances by 44% over the next few years.
McCormick is selling an ají amarillo seasoning on its website beginning February 3 for $9.99 and holding a food festival in Miami later that month serving dishes and drinks using the ingredient.
Part of the growth of the spice can be attribute to the increase in Peruvian restaurants, where ají amarillo is a staple in the cuisine.
The number of Peruvian restaurants that opened across the United States in the past five years jumped 22%, according to Yelp.
One of those newly opened restaurants is Mita , a vegetarian restaurant in Washington, DC, which uses the yellow pepper.
Chef and co-owner Miguel Guerra told CNN that its fruity heat level and vibrant color make it versatile, and people who try it, “definitely fall in love as it's got the right amount of heat, flavor and beautiful color.” .

Title: How the Trump administration is building out its immigration enforcement machine | CNN Politics
# How the Trump administration is building out its immigration enforcement machine | CNN Politics.
Washington CNN — .
President Donald Trump has quickly mobilized wide swaths of the federal government to arrest and detain undocumented immigrants in the United States, part of a broader strategy to amass a large enforcement machine.
The administration has sent troops to the US-Mexico border, utilized military aircraft to repatriate recent border crossers, and deployed people from multiple federal agencies, including those under the Justice Department, to augment immigration enforcement operations.
Those shifts may cause tensions between agencies, as they compete for limited resources and manpower.
The administration is also drawing up plans to expand the government's holding capacity, turning to military bases and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
And private contractors are discussing options amongst themselves as they look to ramp up detention capacity.
“This gets them over one of the biggest hurdles they have which is resources,” said John Sandweg, former acting ICE director under the Obama administration, noting that getting additional funds from Congress will take time.
“By elevating this to a national security priority, tapping into DOD's abundant resources and DOJ with the federal agents, it's an immediate surge of resources,” he added.
The Trump administration is also expected to tap state and local law enforcement in the weeks to come to assist in their efforts to arrest undocumented immigrants.
Combined, the efforts mark a dramatic scaling up of the administration's enforcement apparatus and reflect Trump's aggressive immigration agenda.
White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller told CNN's Jake Tapper Tuesday that arrest quotas for Immigration and Customs Enforcement field offices of 75 per day should be treated as a “floor, not a ceiling.”.
“The goal is to arrest at least that many, but hopefully many more, and the Department of Justice is going to be closely involved in providing the manpower to help achieve those objectives,” Miller said.
'A force multiplier' .
US Customs and Border Protection has also been called upon to assist ICE, as the latter agency's field offices come under increasing pressure, according to multiple sources.
Interior enforcement is complex, often requiring careful planning, surveillance and operations that take place in the predawn hours.
Over the course of the past week, teams of ICE officers, along with agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, deployed nationwide to arrest undocumented immigrants who had been targeted as public safety and national security threats, according to Trump officials.
In an interview with CNN last week, White House border czar Tom Homan touted the joint effort, calling it a “gamechanger,” and describing the teams as a “force multiplier.”.
ICE has historically been underfunded and has a limited number of agents.
Trump officials were keenly aware of that as they prepared in the weeks leading up to Inauguration Day, drafting a spate of memos to delegate powers and trigger authorities, according to two sources familiar.
One of those included a Homeland Security memo requesting the help of state and local governments to enforce federal immigration law, citing a “mass influx” of migrants at the US-Mexico border.
That language was deliberate, according to one of the sources, describing the finding as a tool to trigger new state authorities for immigration enforcement.
The memo allows state and local law enforcement officers to carry out immigration enforcement, by invoking a sweeping legal authority that lets the Homeland Security secretary request aid under certain circumstances.
It's unclear how it would be implemented and whether it will require agreements and training.
Some former Homeland Security officials have raised concerns over pivoting law enforcement to immigration-focused missions and potentially leaving other work unattended.
“They clearly can do it.
But there's an opportunity cost.
What aren't they going to do?
” one former Homeland Security official said.
Enlisting the military.
One of the president's first acts, declaring a national emergency at the border, has already yielded action that was prominently showcased by the White House: the use of Pentagon assets on the US southern border.
The administration expanded its military flights carrying migrants to Ecuador last week, after a public feud with Colombia that almost resulted in a trade war.
And at the request of the Department of Homeland Security, Buckley Space Force Base in Colorado will be used to stage and process immigrants.
The facility is manned by ICE, among other agencies.
“This is only just the beginning,” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said in a post on X Monday.
Trump on Wednesday signed a memorandum directing the federal government to prepare the US Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to house migrants.
The process of expanding the holding facility is expected to last weeks and likely to fall short of Trump's stated goal of 30,000 people, given space constraints.
Guantanamo Bay hosts a separate migrant processing center previously used to temporarily house migrants apprehended at sea.
Under the Biden administration, Homeland Security officials considered using the center to temporarily hold more migrants in the event of mass maritime migration.
The process to expand capacity was expected to take around 30 days, depending on what assistance could be pulled in and how quickly, according to a former Homeland Security official.
Trump's top immigration advisers previously told CNN that management of a Guantanamo Bay detention facility for migrants would be overseen by ICE and reserved for what Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem described as “the worst of the worst.”.
Homan told CNN Wednesday that he wants the Defense Department to be “very involved” in immigration enforcement.
Pressed on how much more money he thinks Congress would need to allocate to fully carry out Trump's immigration plans, Homan said that they are “working on that number now.”.
“We need - the more money we have, the more successful we're going to be, right?
More money for beds, more money for operations,” he said.

Title: What to do when the Fed starts cutting interest rates | CNN Business
# What to do when the Fed starts cutting interest rates | CNN Business.
New York CNN — .
Over the past couple of years, the Federal Reserve aggressively raised its key interest rate to a 23-year high to beat down inflation.
Now that inflation has slowed substantially and is expected to cool further, the central bank is expected to embark on a rate-cutting campaign over the next two years, starting as early as September.
If it does, rates should decline on a wide swath of financial products for Americans, from credit cards and home loans to bank accounts and certificates of deposit, among others.
Given how many ways lower rates can affect your finances, here are some things to consider when deciding what steps to take in response.
## Timing and magnitude matter .
The prospect of lower borrowing costs will be welcome news to those seeking loans or anyone trying to reduce their existing debt loads.
But, realistically, how much you'll save when the Fed lowers rates will depend on how quickly it cuts and by how much each time.
The answer for the near term is most likely to be “not that much.”.
“Interest rates took the elevator going up, but they will take the stairs coming down,” said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.
By that he means: “Rates are not going to fall fast enough to bail you out of a bad situation [this year],” McBride said.
“And for savers, [the initial declines] won't wipe out your interest earnings.
Savers will still be way ahead of the game.”.
That's because one or even two quarter-point rate cuts this year won't meaningfully reduce many of your interest costs.
But several cuts over the next year or two could make a noticeable difference, and it may be worth holding your fire on some moves until then.
“Don't jump the gun too early on this stuff,” said Chris Diodato, a fee-only certified financial planner and founder of WELLth Financial Planning.
Here's a breakdown of how lower rates may affect key areas of your financial life, along with tips from Diodato and McBride on what to do about it.
Getting a mortgage is one of the biggest financial moves most people ever make.
Mortgage rates are influenced by a number of economic factors, and the Fed's moves are one.
Since loan amounts are substantial, this is one area where even small cuts in interest rates could make a meaningful difference in what a homebuyer will pay.
For those buying a home this year, you may be tempted to buy down points to reduce your mortgage rate.
Before doing so, Diodato advised, crunch some numbers to make sure it will actually save you money if you think you may be tempted to refinance in a year or two should rates drop further.
That's because you will pay thousands of dollars to buy down your mortgage rate n

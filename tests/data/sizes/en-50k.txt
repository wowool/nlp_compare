Title: Americans may find themselves paying the cost of tariffs on imports | CNN Politics
# Americans may find themselves paying the cost of tariffs on imports | CNN Politics.
CNN — .
A day after signing steep new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China, President Donald Trump acknowledged what economists, members of Congress and even some of his own aides — in their previous lives — have been saying all along: Americans may find themselves paying the costs .
“THIS WILL BE THE GOLDEN AGE OF AMERICA!
WILL THERE BE SOME PAIN?
YES, MAYBE (AND MAYBE NOT!),” Trump posted, in all capital letters, on his Truth Social platform.
The message, which appeared in the hour before Trump arrived to his West Palm Beach, Florida, golf club for the second day in a row, amounted to an advance warning.
Trump is serious about fulfilling his campaign promises to end illegal immigration, curb the flow of deadly drugs and rebalance continental trade.
But doing so will be uncomfortable, Trump is suggesting, and could serve to undermine another of his top campaign vows: lowering costs for Americans.
“WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AND IT WILL ALL BE WORTH THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID,” Trump wrote.
“WE ARE A COUNTRY THAT IS NOW BEING RUN WITH COMMON SENSE — AND THE RESULTS WILL BE SPECTACULAR!!!”.
Instead of the new trade war lowering grocery or fuel prices, Trump on Sunday pointed to a result he never mentioned when he was running for president: annexing Canada as an American state.
“Canada should become our Cherished 51st State.
Much lower taxes, and far better military protection for the people of Canada — AND NO TARIFFS!
” he said, repeating an idea he's floated repeatedly since winning the election late last year.
As industries brace for the new tariffs — 25% on goods from Mexico and Canada, and 10% on imports from China — it remains to be seen how long it will take for higher costs to have an impact on American consumers.
The tariffs are set to go into effect Tuesday at 12:01 a.m. ET.
In a tacit acknowledgement that upside pressures could affect Americans' gas and heating costs, Trump levied only a 10% tariff on Canadian oil and gas.
Already, Canada and Mexico have moved to retaliate — reluctantly, in the case of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who said during a somber address from Ottawa late Saturday: “We don't want to be here.”.
Canada's former finance minister Chrystia Freeland, who is running to replace Trudeau as prime minister, said her country would rather not get into a trade war with the US but is determined to stand up for itself.
“We don't want to have this fight, but we are not going to lose it,” she told CNN's Fareed Zakaria on Sunday, calling it a “lose-lose” situation that will end up hurting Americans, since they depend on Canada for many basic goods.
If the back-and-forth tariffs remain in place for a prolonged period, the “pain” Trump warned of could become a reality.
Sen. Tim Kaine argued Sunday on “State of the Union” that Americans will see increased prices at the pump within days and that American businesses will be harmed once the other nations' retaliatory tariffs kick in.
“I'm struck by the irony.
Last week, the president signed an emergency order regarding energy.
There's an energy emergency.
And he just put a 10% tariff on energy from Canada?
” the Virginia Democrat told CNN's Jake Tapper, adding, “The emergency is self-created.”.
Democratic Gov.
Andy Beshear of Kentucky, which Trump won by more than 30 percentage points in the 2024 election, warned of the potential impacts on the state's bourbon industry after the provinces of British Columbia and Ontario directed their liquor boards to remove American alcohol from shelves.
But even some Trump allies have privately hoped that after implementing the harsh new duties — and proving to the world he's willing to act decisively — Trump could eventually ease up, as long as he's extracted some concessions.
Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, told “Fox News Sunday” that the tariffs “are designed to bring about change.
And if the change comes, I think the tariffs probably go away.”.
What exactly those concessions might be, however, isn't clear.
Before implementing the tariffs, Trump did not meet or speak on the telephone with Trudeau or with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum to spell out his demands.
Trudeau said Saturday he'd been trying to reach Trump since the inauguration, but his calls have not been returned.
Briefing reporters Saturday evening, White House officials declined to lay out specific benchmarks that Canada or Mexico could reach in tightening their borders or curbing fentanyl flows that would allow the tariffs to be lifted.
And Trump himself told reporters late Friday he wasn't looking for any concessions at all.
In his social media posting Sunday morning, his rationale for the tariffs extended well beyond punishment for the illicit flow of fentanyl.
“The USA has major deficits with Canada, Mexico, and China (and almost all countries!), owes 36 Trillion Dollars, and we're not going to be the 'Stupid Country' any longer,” he wrote.
“MAKE YOUR PRODUCT IN THE USA AND THERE ARE NO TARIFFS!”.

Title: Inside the grueling effort to recover the bodies of all 67 victims from the mangled wreckage of DC plane collision | CNN
# Inside the grueling effort to recover the bodies of all 67 victims from the mangled wreckage of DC plane collision | CNN.
CNN — .
Families were waiting at the airport to welcome home loved ones when their plane, just minutes from landing, collided midair with a military helicopter in a fiery explosion, plunging 67 lives full of promise into the cold, inky waters of the Potomac River.
The frantic search for survivors started under the cloak of icy darkness.
By morning, the mission had turned into a slow and somber search for the remains of everyone on board.
As of Sunday afternoon, 55 bodies have been identified, DC Fire and EMS Chief John Donnelly said, with the search effort hampered by near-zero visibility in the frigid water , sharp pieces of debris and the mangled metal of the wreckage.
Amid heated political speculation on the cause of Wednesday night's collision and grief-stricken stories from heartbroken loved ones, hundreds of rescue personnel continue to search relentlessly for the remains of every person lost.
“They're getting home and they're crashing and falling into really deep sleeps, and then getting up and going back to work and doing it again,” David Hoagland, president of the Washington, DC, Firefighters Local 36, told CNN.
“However long it takes, they're going to be there.”.
Days later, dangerous and difficult conditions persist, hindering the careful and deliberate efforts of crews working to recover the bodies of victims trapped deep within the wreckage, beyond the reach of divers.
The recovery effort has been extensive, involving nearly every dive team in the area, including the US Coast Guard, the FBI's Washington Field Office dive team, DC Fire and the International Association of Fire Fighters.
Here's how their efforts are unfolding.
## Heavier equipment needed to remove remaining bodies .
The mangled wreckage in the Potomac River has made the recovery effort especially difficult for dive teams, who have struggled to access parts of the plane's fuselage.
These sections will need to be removed to retrieve the remaining bodies, Donnelly said.
“Things have kind of slowed down this weekend because they're waiting on a lot more heavier salvage equipment that's going to be showing up sometime in the next 24 to 36 hours,” Hoagland told CNN on Saturday.
“They're going to be setting up for a pretty complicated operation where they're going to be removing plane parts from the water on Monday.”.
The wreckage of the American Airlines jet broke apart, according to Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy.
The fuselage was found upside down in three sections in the river, which is about 8 feet deep in some areas.
Divers have been using specialized underwater hydraulic rescue tools capable of cutting metal to try to recover as many victims as possible, Hoagland said.
Asked whether authorities are confident about the location of the remaining bodies, Donnelly said, “We think we know where they are,” but “we won't know until we're done.”.
“I believe that when we remove the aircraft, that that will help us resolve this number,” he said.
“If it doesn't, we will continue the search.”.
The Army Corps of Engineers will start working to remove the remnants of the jet Monday, according to a news release .
Then, engineers will switch their focus to the remnants of the Black Hawk helicopter involved in the collision.
They expect to finish removing the wreckage by February 12, the release says.
A US Coast Guard boat equipped with a crane was used Friday to hold the door of the US Army Black Hawk helicopter, allowing for the retrieval of the bodies of all three service members, followed by the “dignified transfer of their remains,” Hoagland said.
The wreckage of the helicopter was located about 300 yards from the plane debris, according to Hoagland.
Most of Friday's recovery operations focused on the Black Hawk.
Recovery teams are planning to bring a larger crane to the Potomac crash site to help reach victims in a section of the wreckage divers can't access, a law enforcement source told CNN.
The crane, used to remove parts of the Francis Scott Key Bridge after its collapse last March, will be employed to cut and lift pieces of the airplane.
This will allow divers to safely recover additional victims who are pinned inside and extremely difficult to access.
“With these really large marine salvage cranes and vessels, as you can imagine, these things are not very seaworthy,” Hoagland said.
“They can't move very fast because they've got giant cranes on them, so it's slow sail to get up the bay and then into the river to get up to DC.”.
Rescue teams are also on the water using technology such as sonar scanning to continue their search and deploy divers.
Additionally, crews will search sewer lines and conduct aerial operations as dive teams work in targeted areas, according to Donnelly.
## Dangerous, difficult and risky conditions .
When a direct line to Reagan National Airport rang Wednesday night, Hoagland said, Local 36 first responders expected a routine report of a flight in distress.
Instead, they heard: “Crash!
Crash!
Crash!
” he recalled.
As union members rushed to a pier to board a fireboat, burning debris rained down on Potomac.
First responders arrived to find wreckage submerged in the shallow water and almost immediately started finding victims, Hoagland said.
Some passengers were still strapped to their seats, but removing them proved difficult as sharp pieces of debris tore the wetsuits worn by first responders.
“They had a lot working against them.
They had the current in the river.
They had jet fuel all over in the water with them.
They had debris.
They had ice,” Edward Kelly, general president of the International Association of Fire Fighters, told CNN on Thursday. “
Like I said, the swift current was a challenge, searching the fuselage - there's a lot of sharp objects in the cockpit - so it was a very difficult and risky and dangerous rescue attempt.”.
At one point, there were close to 50 divers in the water responding to the incident, he said.
“One thing that was a blessing was the civilian dinner boat in DC did a trip up the Potomac yesterday, which actually broke the ice that allowed the smaller boats to respond to the actual crash last night,” he said.
On the night of the crash, emergency crews battled icy, choppy waters, Donnelly said . .
“The water is dark, it is murky, and that is a very tough condition for them to dive in.
If you can imagine, the river is a large black spot at night with no lights on it, except for a few buoy lights,” Donnelly said.
Friday, search crews continued to exercise caution as weather conditions posed challenges for recovery efforts, Donnelly said.
Divers faced intense mud and near-zero visibility, despite the aircraft resting in only a few feet of water.
“That's actually part of the challenge, is that you're half swimming, half walking while you're working.
This is very strenuous for our divers or rescue swimmers that are in the water,” Donnelly said, referring to the silt at the bottom.
Saturday, calmer weather — with sunshine and fewer winds — helped with visibility, but ice and debris remained critical hazards, Hoagland told CNN.
He added officials are still in the process of mapping the debris field.
“Now that it's a recovery operation, it's much more important to preserve evidence so they can investigate the crash, so they're going to go about it systematically, methodically and intentionally,” Hoagland said.
“They're doing a good job of cataloging and mapping everything by sonar and figuring out where everything is, but it's a tedious, long effort.”.
With the operation shifted from a rescue to a recovery mission, responders are adopting an approach that prioritizes safety, according to Kelly.
For instance, responders will not perform dangerous night dives.
First responders and emergency personnel, who have been working around the clock for days — first desperately searching for survivors, and now recovering remains — are exhausted, Hoagland said, but remain resilient.
“Everybody just really wants to see things through,” Hoagland told CNN.
“We're looking out for each other, and everybody's getting breaks.”.
Recovering the bodies and remains of the victims, especially the children, has been both harrowing and exhausting, Hoagland said, a process that will likely leave a lasting emotional and mental impact on first responders.
To support first responders dealing with the trauma of what they're witnessing on the scene, the International Association of Fire Fighters has deployed teams of former firefighters trained as mental health counselors to assist with ongoing recovery efforts.
“If somebody's really just having a tough time and they need to hit the pause button, they can talk to them and help them decompress and process all the trauma they might be experiencing,” Hoagland said.
There are enough teams on the ground for everyone to provide each other with peer support and take someone's place if they are overwhelmed and need a break, Hoagland said.
Donnelly also emphasized the importance of making sure personnel “understand that the feelings they have are normal and how to get help if there's any feelings that aren't going away, the signs and symptoms, if you're having trouble sleeping, if you aren't eating well, we don't want you to drink, we don't want you arguing with your family,” he said in a news conference Sunday.
The US Coast Guard has Critical Incident Stress Management therapists and chaplains who are waiting for US Coast Guard crews to return to home base and will provide them with mental health support immediately, the agency's Capt. Patrick Burkett said at the news conference.
“This is not normal, and it's OK for them to not feel OK,” Burkett said.
“This is a tragedy,” Donnelly said.
“We are in a business where we deal with the loss of life or people being hurt and one person is bad, and it's hard — and 67 is a lot.”.
The National Transportation Safety Board will allow first responders to complete their work before beginning its investigation into the collision, the board's chair said Thursday.
NTSB Chair Jennifer L. Homendy described it as an “all-hands-on-deck event.”
The NTSB had a full crew on the scene Thursday, with about 50 people at the crash site and additional personnel at the agency's headquarters and labs across the country ready to assist.
But first, “we allow the responders to do their important safety mission, which in this case was search and rescue and recovery,” she said.
“We stand back to allow them to do their important safety mission.”.
Homendy emphasized the NTSB will “leave no stone unturned in this investigation” and that it will be a “whole-of-government effort.”.

Title: Luka Doncic breaks silence following trade from Dallas Mavericks: 'I wanted so badly to bring you a championship' | CNN
# Luka Doncic breaks silence following trade from Dallas Mavericks: 'I wanted so badly to bring you a championship' | CNN.
CNN — .
In his first comments since being traded to the Los Angeles Lakers earlier Sunday, NBA superstar Luka Doncic penned a thank you letter to the Dallas Mavericks, their fans and the city of Dallas.
“Seven years ago, I came here as a teenager to pursue my dream of playing basketball at the highest level,” Doncic wrote in a post on X. “I thought I'd spend my career here and I wanted so badly to bring you a championship.
The love and support you all have given me is more than I could have ever dreamed of.
For a young kid from Slovenia coming to the U.S. for the first time, you made North Texas feel like home.” .
In one of the most stunning trades in league history, the Lakers acquired Doncic, as well as Maxi Kleber, Markieff Morris from the Dallas Mavericks for Anthony Davis, Max Christie and the Lakers' 2029 first-round draft pick.
ESPN's Shams Charania first broke the news of the blockbuster trade on Saturday, citing sources.
“In good times and bad, from injuries to the NBA Finals, your support never changed,” Doncic continued.
“Thank you not only for sharing my joy in our best moments, but also for lifting me up when I needed it most.”.
Doncic, 25, is currently out with a calf injury but has averaged 28.1 points, 8.3 rebounds and 7.8 assists per game in 22 games with the Mavericks this season.
Doncic added: “To all the organizations I've worked with throughout the Dallas community, thank you for letting me contribute to your important work and join you in bringing light to those who need it.
As I start the next part of my basketball journey, I am leaving a city that will always feel like a home away from home.”.
A part of the three-team deal, the Utah Jazz are acquiring Jalen Hood-Schifino, a 2025 Los Angeles Clippers second-round draft pick, and a 2025 Mavericks second-round pick to round out the trade.
The five-time All-Star said he was “grateful” for the opportunity to play in Los Angeles alongside LeBron James.
“Basketball means everything to me, and no matter where I play the game, I'll do so with the same joy, passion and goal - to win championships.,” Doncic said.
Per ESPN's Tim MacMahon, the Mavericks had “major concerns” with Doncic's conditioning and impending potential supermax contract extension.
Even with those concerns going public, it's still a shocking decision by the organization - Doncic was on the All-NBA Team for the last five years and made five consecutive All Star teams before this season when he's been limited by injury.
“Dallas is a special place, and Mavs fans are special fans.
Thank you, from the bottom of my heart,” Doncic posted .
While there is no timetable for Doncic's return to the court, the Lakers are next scheduled to play on Tuesday against crosstown rivals Los Angeles Clippers at the Intuit Dome.

Title: A trans National Guard pilot was falsely accused of flying the helicopter in the fatal plane collision | CNN Business
# A trans National Guard pilot was falsely accused of flying the helicopter in the fatal plane collision | CNN Business.
CNN — .
A trans member of the National Guard is speaking out after a wave of claims on social media falsely pointed to her as the pilot of the Black Hawk helicopter that collided with a passenger jet in Washington, Wednesday, killing 67 people.
Jo Ellis, a UH60 Black Hawk helicopter pilot for the Virginia Army National Guard, posted on Facebook Friday to dispel the rumors that had echoed President Donald Trump's unsubstantiated blaming of diversity initiatives for the fatal accident.
“Some craziness has happened on the internet and I'm being named as one of the pilots of the DC crash,” Ellis wrote.
“It's insulting to the victims and families of those lost and they deserve better than this BS from the bots and trolls of the internet.”.
In her Facebook post, Ellis shared a screenshot of two X posts that linked her being trans to the catastrophic crash, with one user saying they “wouldn't be surprised” if “the pilot was trans” in response to another post that claimed Ellis “has been making radicalized anti-Trump statements on socials.
The latter account has since deleted the post and published an apology .
A separate account, which has a blue checkmark and 13,600 followers, shared a now-deleted post directly attacking Ellis and spreading the bogus conspiracy theory.
While the account has likewise issued a correction , the post still raked in at least 195,000 views and was reshared almost 1,000 times before being deleted.
At the time of both corrections, “Jo Ellis” was the No. 3 trending topic on X, with 19,400 posts.
And, despite Ellis' correction — which she further addressed in a follow-up Facebook video , captioned “proof of life” — far-right accounts on X have continued to spread misinformation and hate speech.
Ellis' erroneous scapegoating in far-right circles follows the ﻿guardswoman's publicized sit-down with CNN's Michael Smerconish, slated to appear in Saturday's episode of “The Smerconish Podcast” during which she discussed her service and experiences with gender dysphoria.
In an essay for Smerconish's newsletter , Ellis also discussed her story, writing about transitioning while serving in the military.
Hate speech following the crash echoed recent attacks from Trump on DEI initiatives and executive actions targeting transgender Americans.
Since returning to the Oval Office, Trump has repeatedly taken aim at transgender people, saying in his inauguration speech “that there are only two genders: male and female.”
Amid his flurry of executive orders, Trump has also re-banned transgender Americans from serving in the military , reviving his 2017 order that was repealed by then-President Joe Biden in 2021 .
And, in his first White House briefing room address , Trump directly linked the crash to DEI while also blaming initiatives from Democrats.
“We must have only the highest standards for those who work in our aviation system,” Trump said.
“I changed the Obama standards from very mediocre at best to extraordinary, you remember that.”.
“Only the highest aptitude, they have to be the highest intellect and psychologically superior people, were allowed to qualify for air traffic controllers,” he said.
In a Thursday White House memo , Trump blamed the Obama administration's implementation of “a biographical questionnaire at the FAA to shift the hiring focus away from objective aptitude,” further linking the crash to DEI initiatives.
“The Biden Administration egregiously rejected merit-based hiring, requiring all executive departments and agencies to implement dangerous 'diversity equity and inclusion' tactics, and specifically recruiting individuals with “severe intellectual” disabilities in the FAA,” Trump wrote in the memo.
Neither the memo nor Trump's press conference provided any evidence to support his brazen claims.
When one reporter pressed the president for an explanation of his diversity claims during the press conference, Trump again failed to provide evidence, responding simply: “Because common sense and unfortunately a lot of people don't.”.
Baseless DEI attacks have become one of the key pillars of the president's MAGA platform, and Trump is far from alone in linking disasters to diversity initiatives.
When disastrous wildfires erupted in California, Elon Musk used his X pulpit to claim “DEI means people DIE,” while others took aim at Karen Bass , the first woman and second black person to serve as Los Angeles mayor.
Conservatives likewise blamed Kristin Crowley , the city's first woman and openly gay fire chief, for the wildfires that killed 28 people.
Other incidents have also been linked to DEI initiatives.
Rep. Dan Meuser told Fox News that the New Orleans' New Years Day tragedy was because “the priority of the last four years has been DEI, not IEDs.”
And Phil Lyman , the one-time Maryland gubernatorial hopeful, blamed the Baltimore Key Brdieg disaster on “governors who prioritize diversity.” .

# UK to target AI child sex abuse tools in world first legal crackdown | CNN.
London Reuters — .
Britain will make it illegal to use artificial intelligence tools that create child sexual abuse images, it said on Saturday, becoming the first country in the world to introduce the new AI sexual abuse offenses.
Possessing, taking, making, showing or distributing explicit images of children is a crime in England and Wales.
The new offenses target the use of AI tools to “nudeify” real-life images of children.
The move comes as online criminals increasingly use AI to create child abuse material, with reports of such explicit images rising nearly five-fold in 2024, according to the Internet Watch Foundation.
“We know that sick predators' activities online often lead to them carrying out the most horrific abuse in person,” said Yvette Cooper, the United Kingdom's interior minister.
“It is vital that we tackle child sexual abuse online as well as offline so we can better protect the public from new and emerging crimes.”.
Predators also use AI tools to disguise their identity and blackmail children with fake images to force them into further abuse, such as by streaming live images, the government said.
The new criminal offenses include the possession, creation or distribution of AI tools designed to create child sexual abuse material and the possession of so-called AI “pedophile manuals,” which provide instructions on the usage of the technology.
Another specific offense will target those who run websites on which child sexual abuse content is distributed.
The government will also enable authorities to unlock digital devices for inspection.
The measures will be included in the Crime and Policing Bill when it comes to parliament.
Britain said earlier this month it would also make the creation and sharing of sexually explicit “deepfakes” - videos, pictures or audio clips made with AI to look real - a criminal offense.

Title: Karla Sofía Gascón says she will not withdraw from Oscar contention over past comments: 'I have not committed any crime' | CNN
# Karla Sofía Gascón says she will not withdraw from Oscar contention over past comments: 'I have not committed any crime' | CNN.
CNN — .
Oscar nominee Karla Sofía Gascón, the star of “Emilia Pérez,” is staying in the race for best actress despite controversy over offensive social media posts .
In an interview with CNN's Juan Carlos Arciniegas, Gascón, who made history last month as the first openly transgender actress nominated for an Oscar in an acting category, once again offered her “most sincere apologies to all the people who may have felt offended.”.
“I cannot step down from an Oscar nomination because I have not committed any crime nor have I harmed anyone.
I am neither racist nor anything that all these people have tried to make others believe I am,” Gascón told CNN.
The controversy arose after journalist Sarah Hagi shared screenshots of Gascón's old social media posts, in which she was critical of Muslim culture, the death of George Floyd and the direction of the Oscars.
Gascón, who deactivated her account on X following the controversy, apologized this week for her posts.
“I want to address the conversation around my past social media posts that have caused harm,” Gascón said in a statement shared with CNN.
“As a member of a marginalized community, I know this suffering all too well and deeply regret having caused pain.
All my life I have fought for a better world.
I believe that light will always triumph over darkness.”.
In one of the posts, originally written in Spanish, Gascón commented on the Floyd case, who died in 2020 after an encounter with police in Minneapolis.
“I really believe that very few ever cared about George Floyd, a scammer drug addict,” she wrote in part.
The actress also criticized the 2021 Oscars ceremony, held amid the Covid-19 pandemic.
“The #Oscars are increasingly resembling an independent and vindicative film awards ceremony, I didn't know if I was watching an Afro-Korean festival, a Black Lives Matter demonstration, or March 8th,” she posted at the time.
In her interview with CNN, Gascón said she didn't “recognize” some of the posts that have resurfaced.
“I have been judged, condemned, sacrificed, crucified, and stoned without a trial and without the option to defend myself,” Gascón said.
She denied writing a since-deleted 2022 tweet in which Selena Gomez, her co-star in “Emilia Pérez,” was described derogatorily.
“It's not mine, of course, I have never said anything about my colleague, I would never refer to her that way,” Gascón said.
Gascón is nominated for an Oscar for best actress for her role in “Emilia Pérez,” a Netflix musical and crime drama that tells the story of a Mexican drug trafficker seeking gender reassignment surgery, which has also generated much controversy, especially in Mexico.
Jacques Audiard, the French director of “Emilia Pérez,” defended the film in an interview with CNN en Español in January, saying, “If there are things that seem scandalous to Mexicans in 'Emilia,' I apologize.” .

# Best red carpet looks at the 2025 Grammys | CNN.
CNN — .
The Grammy Awards are renowned for outlandish fashion.
But on a night of tributes to first responders and victims of LA's recent wildfires, many guests struck a comparatively restrained note at the Crypto.com arena on Sunday.
The all-black trend seen at recent award ceremonies was embraced by everyone from Miley Cyrus (in a cut-out leather Saint Laurent dress) to Olivia Rodrigo (in a slinky halter neck Versace number).
Lady Gaga set a somber tone in a dramatic long-sleeved ball gown by Vivienne Westwood, though some attendees took a more light-hearted approach, whether it was J Balvin's long silk Dior Men coat or the sailor hat Billie Eilish wore with her Prada suit.
Guests also showed their support for LA — which has hosted the Grammys more times than any other city in its 66-year history — by wearing blue heart pins.
Brittany Howard, Jaden Smith and Jacob Collier were among those seen sporting the pins in support of MusiCares, a charity raising money for music industry professionals impacted by the fires.
Elsewhere, several of the evening's most anticipated arrivals used feathers to add volume or definition to their outfits.
Sabrina Carpenter wowed in a custom JW Anderson gown with elegant accents, while the beads and sequins of Cardi B's Roberto Cavalli Couture mermaid gown turned into an autumnal plume as it trailed to the floor.
Meanwhile, Charli XCX and Chappell Roan, who were among the night's most nominated artists, achieved similarly eye-catching effects with ruffles and cascading tulle.
It was perhaps no surprise that both gowns were by the same designer, Jean Paul Gaultier, albeit from very different eras: Charli XCX's outfit was a custom look from the Spring-Summer 2025 runway, while Roan opted for an archive piece from Gaultier's Spring 2003 couture collection.
And this wouldn't be the Grammy's without a bit of skin — or the illusion of it.
The various takes on nude ranged from the subtle (see Madison Beer's divine strapless gown and the sheer detailing of Shakira's Etro dress) to the not-so-subtle.
Ye's wife Bianca Censori left little to the imagination, shocking onlookers by dropping her coat to reveal a see-through slip dress that was, in every sense, barely there.
See below for some of the event's best and boldest looks.
This story will be updated throughout the evening.

Title: Education Department employees placed on paid leave as part of Trump administration's DEI purge | CNN Politics
# Education Department employees placed on paid leave as part of Trump administration's DEI purge | CNN Politics.
CNN — .
Dozens of employees at the Education Department were placed on paid administrative leave Friday as part of the Trump administration's larger effort to rid the federal workforce of employees associated with diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility efforts, two sources familiar with the move told CNN.
The department sent letters to employees informing them that their email accounts were being suspended but that they would continue to receive paychecks for an indefinite period, the sources said.
The department cited guidance from the White House's Office of Personnel and Management, issued on January 21, that directed government agencies to notify “all employees of DEIA offices that they are being placed on paid administrative leave effective immediately as the agency takes steps to close/end all DEIA initiatives, offices and programs.” .
The agency is the latest to face upheaval amid the White House's efforts to weed out DEI programs within the government and reshape the federal workforce in President Donald Trump's image.
At least 55 Education Department employees, including senior-level career workers who have served at the agency for decades, were notified Friday night that they'd been placed on paid leave, according to the American Federation of Government Employees, the union representing the agency's career officials.
“Effective January 31, 2025, you will be placed on administrative leave with full pay and benefits pursuant to the President's executive order on DEIA and further guidance from OPM,” the letter says, according to a copy obtained by CNN.
“This administrative leave is not being done for any disciplinary purpose.”.
According to the union, these employees do not hold job titles nor official duties related to DEIA, but they included staffers such as civil rights attorneys who handle student discrimination and antisemitism complaints; an employee working in a grant office; and a member of the artificial intelligence team helping the department understand AI in education.
But Sheria Smith, union president for Department of Education career employees, told CNN the employees placed on paid leave had attended a two-day diversity training seminar in 2019 during the first Trump administration “that was required for senior-level employees and strongly encouraged for others,” as well as similar training under the Biden administration.
Others affected had either participated in a one-day lunch training on DEI or had volunteered with an agency group or committee that plans programs such as Black History Month celebrations.
The diversity training for Education Department employees was encouraged during the first Trump administration under then-Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, whose goal was for 400 employees to attend the sessions, according to the union.
Because of the large participation in the 2019 training seminar, the union is worried that hundreds more Department of Education staffers could be affected.
“We've filed several requests for information with the agency to get a clear understanding of what's happening and how many employees overall will be impacted,” Smith told CNN, but the union has not received any additional information.
CNN reached out to the Department of Education for comment but did not receive a response.
The New York Times first reported on the letters sent to Education Department employees informing them that they were being put on paid administrative leave.
The White House last month ordered government DEI employees to be placed on administrative leave and ended the use of DEI in hiring and federal contracting.
“The mission of the agency is stalled because this administration has forced these people to stop performing work for the American people,” Smith told CNN.
Agency leaders were also instructed to ask employees to report any efforts to “disguise these programs” in federal jobs and contract descriptions since the November election.

New York CNN — .
The DeepSeek drama may have been briefly eclipsed by, you know, everything in Washington (which, if you can believe it, got even crazier Wednesday).
But rest assured that over in Silicon Valley , there has been nonstop, Olympic-level pearl-clutching over this Chinese upstart that managed to singlehandedly wipe out hundreds of billions of dollars in market cap in just a few hours and put America's mighty tech titans on their heels.
ICYMI: DeepSeek is a Chinese AI lab with a model that's similar to ChatGPT, and people are freaking out over it because of its engineers' claims about how they built it — cheaply, using a small fraction of the computing power used by US labs like OpenAI.
Big picture: DeepSeek has forced tech bros and their investors to question the industry's core assumption that they need gajillions more dollars to effectively secure enough energy to power their AI advancements.
Now, perhaps not unexpectedly, American tech leaders are trying to shift the narrative to make DeepSeek look like the villain. (And you gotta suspect none of these guys — they're mostly guys — paid attention in English class because they appear fully unaware of the excruciating irony — some might say hypocrisy — baked into their accusations.) .
On Tuesday, Bloomberg and the Financial Times reported that OpenAI and Microsoft, its biggest investor, are looking into evidence that DeepSeek used OpenAI's intellectual property to build its competitor, violating its terms of service.
An OpenAI spokesperson confirmed to CNN on Wednesday that the company is “aware of and reviewing indications that DeepSeek may have inappropriately distilled our models, and will share information as we know more.” .
“Distilling” isn't exactly stealing , but it is a kind of copycat maneuver used by developers to train smaller AI models on the performance of larger, more sophisticated ones. (More on that in a moment.) .
CNN One Thing Trump's 'America First' Agenda Meets China's AI Advancement Wall Steet, Washington, and Silicon Valley are scrambling after a little-known Chinese startup claimed its artificial intelligence model can operate like ChatGPT at just a fraction of the cost.
We examine why the breakthrough could reverberate beyond the tech sector as President Donald Trump looks to counter China's influence.

So, to recap: OpenAI, a startup that's built on a foundation of data it scraped from the internet without permission , is pointing the finger at another startup allegedly doing… more or less the same thing.
As a reminder, OpenAI is currently mired in litigation with various content creators, including the New York Times , who accuse the company of training its large language models on copyrighted material. (OpenAI doesn't deny using the material but has argued that it's not copyright infringement because the content falls under the legal doctrine known as “fair use.”) .
The irony might have been best summed up in a headline from tech news site 404 Media: “OpenAI Furious DeepSeek Might Have Stolen All the Data OpenAI Stole From Us.” .
Some prominent tech figures greeted the allegations from OpenAI with a shrug, noting that distilling is practically standard practice in the AI industry.
“I'd be surprised if DeepSeek hadn't used it,” said Lutz Finger, senior visiting lecturer at Cornell University.
“Technically, it's easy to do,” he added, and “if done well, it is easy to disguise and avoid detection, thus I would be equally surprised if we ever get proof of such tactics.”.
Tech venture capitalist Bill Gurley wrote on X that “the core algorithm everyone uses was developed at DeepMind,” Google's AI lab.
“No one disputes that.
The vast majority of LLM insights and breakthroughs are 'borrowed.'
”.
So yeah, maybe OpenAI is having a bit of a sour grapes moment over a foreign rival making it look bad on the global stage.
Whatever.
The more generous read is that OpenAI, as the poster child of American AI innovation, is trying to establish some rules in what is an unregulated and rapidly expanding industry that few people outside of it understand at a technical level.
For example, there is a fine line between “distillation” and “extraction,” explains Zack Kass, an AI consultant and former OpenAI go-to-market lead.
“Distillation is a common practice in AI, but it's typically done within the same organization that owns both models,” he said in an email.
“If DeepSeek trained its model by querying ChatGPT at scale and using the responses to teach its own model, it raises legitimate concerns about whether that constitutes unauthorized use of OpenAI's API,” Kass said.
“Regardless of the specifics here, we're entering a phase where the AI community will have to define clearer norms around what constitutes fair use versus unauthorized replication.”.

CNN — .
Like most of us, Earth has a lot going on under the surface — even in what may have once seemed to be its most unassuming layer.
The mantle, a zone between our planet's thin crust and the molten core, features 1,800 miles (2,900 kilometers) of mostly solid rock, with a consistency like thickened caramel that scientists long hypothesized was uniformly blended.
But massive unmixed regions have been found lingering in the mantle, like lumps of chocolate in a cookie, and new findings are just beginning to reveal their secrets.
Among the enigmatic mantle lumps are two enormous “supercontinents” buried thousands of kilometers below the crust amid the remains of ancient tectonic plates.
One supercontinent lies under Africa, and the other resides deep under the Pacific Ocean.
Using a new method to analyze data from earthquakes, researchers recently uncovered previously unknown details about these vast island regions, revealing that they may serve as anchors in our planet's mantle and that they could be much older than previously thought.
The discovery adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that the rocky mantle isn't as well-stirred by Earth's internal churning as once believed.
And hidden structures or pockets of unblended material, such as these supercontinents, may shape mantle activity, including plate movement, in ways that are yet to be understood, scientists reported January 22 in the journal Nature .
“These findings will contribute to a better understanding of mantle convection and plate tectonics, and, therefore, phenomena we experience at the surface like earthquakes and volcanism,” said Claire Richardson , a doctoral candidate in the School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University, who was not involved in the new research.
“Resolving the physical, thermal, and chemical properties of rocks ~3000 km (1,864 miles) below our feet, at extreme temperatures and pressures, is a challenging problem to say the least,” Richardson told CNN in an email.
“Open questions abound, and each new study gets us closer to understanding what's really going on down there.”.
Researchers first spotted the subterranean supercontinents about 50 years ago when they popped up as anomalies in seismic data generated by earthquakes powerful enough to send reverberations through the planet.
When seismic waves encounter unusual structures in the mantle, changes in wave speed provide seismologists with clues about Earth's deep interior.
Over the decades, seismic data revealed that these supercontinents make up about 20% of the mantle-core boundary.
Each of the buried islands covers hundreds of thousands of miles, and in some spots they tower nearly 600 miles (965 kilometers) tall.
However, little was known about what they were made of, when they sank and what role they might play in mantle flow, known as convection, said Dr. Sujania Talavera-Soza , lead author of the new study and a geosciences and seismology researcher at Utrecht University in the Netherlands.
“Their origin and whether they are long-lived structures — it's widely debated,” Talavera-Soza said.
Earlier research focused on the velocity of seismic waves, showing that wave speed slowed by about 2% upon arriving at the supercontinents.
This slowing of seismic waves led geologists to name the regions large low shear velocity provinces, or LLSVPs.
Velocity loss in seismic waves suggested that these mantle zones were hotter than the rocks around them, Talavera-Soza said.
But it was unknown whether the LLSVPs differed structurally from nearby regions.
Scientists were also uncertain whether the supercontinents were actively involved in convection, or if they were “kind of dense piles that would just be sitting there,” said study coauthor Dr. Arwen Deuss , a professor of structure and composition of Earth's deep interior at Utrecht University.
“There was no information about that,” Deuss said.
“We only knew that seismic waves slowed down.”.
In the new study, the authors used a different approach for studying the LLSVPs to see if they could tease out details about the zones' composition and activity.
They looked at the attenuation, or intensity, of seismic signals as they traveled through the mantle to see how much energy the vibrations from quakes lost.
In music, attenuation is comparable to damping a tone, which produces a lower volume, Deuss said.
Examining the attenuation of the waves — along with changes in wave speed — could provide previously unseen clues about LLSVPs' makeup.
The best data for this is from waves produced by earthquakes that are magnitude 7.8 or higher, Talavera-Soza added.
Wave speed and energy loss were known to be affected by mineral grain size as well as temperature, so the authors used a physics model that linked seismology and mineral physics.
Waves are damped more when they encounter material made of smaller grains; if lots of grains are packed together, there are more boundaries between the grains that can sap a wave's energy.
Other studies revealed that the supercontinents had company in the deep mantle.
Around them were “ slab graveyards ” of sunken tectonic plates, Deuss said.
They were cooler than the LLSVPs, so seismic waves moved through them more quickly.
However, the new model showed that while seismic waves' velocity dipped when they reached LLSVPs, the waves didn't lose much energy.
By comparison, there was significant damping among the cooler graveyards around the LLSVPs.
Researchers believe those differences come down to the comparative ages of the structures.
Over millions of years, as rocky material descends through the boundary between the upper and lower mantle, mineral crystals are compressed and reformed into tinier grains that then regrow over time.
Younger regions therefore have smaller crystals, which suck more energy from seismic waves, so the amount of damping in a region hints at how old it is.
“The fact that the LLSVPs show very little damping, means that they must consist of much larger grains tha
